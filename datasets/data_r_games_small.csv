If you clicked this post, it means youre interested. Because of the Pandemic im bored out of my mind I have too much freetime and noone to play with. If you would like to play minecraft with me (Ill host a server on a server hosting website), you need to be around 13 years old and have discord. It will be a SMP with a custom map (depending if the people in my smp want one) or a SMP with a vanilla map. Ill also if the host allows it give everyone permission to start up the server since i am not much active. Times where i play may vary. The SMP will be opened when we discuss what kind of smp it will be in the discord server. (PS: You dont need a specified 1.16 version since im gonna install protocolsupport). Any further information will be told in the discord server.

&gt;‎Knockout City is a fun multiplayer video game that takes advantage of a well-designed playable section, and very accessible mechanics that work wonders. As it is a game as a service it is inevitable that doubt will arise whether it will be able to have enough personality to be considered a success, and even if the base is good and the developers have great plans for the future, there are certain superficial elements that deserve to be explored in greater depth.‎

**[Attack of the Fanboy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy)** - [Diego Perez](https://opencritic.com/critic/6269/diego-perez) - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/knockout-city-review/)

&gt;Knockout City is an absolute blast, even if it doesn't have many reasons to return after players have had their fill.

**[Daily Mirror](https://opencritic.com/outlet/561/daily-mirror)** - [Jasper Pickering](https://opencritic.com/critic/5469/jasper-pickering) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/knockout-city-review-ballsy-competitive-24148494)

&gt;Knockout City is a fresh take in the sphere of competitive gaming that takes a simple idea and runs with it leaving for some incredibly memorable online encounters though not necessarily for all the right reasons.

**[DualShockers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers)** - [Kyle Knight](https://opencritic.com/critic/8250/kyle-knight) - [7 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/knockout-city-review/)

&gt;Overall, Knockout City is a quirky game that players will find most enjoyable when teaming up with their friends. It struggles with pacing from time to time and could do with some quality of life improvements such as POI names for competitive callouts, some form of a mini-map to locate teammates, and a menu overhaul. However, it balances elements that players will feel familiar with whilst also successfully putting an individual spin on things.

&gt;It took only a few hours spent in the company of Knockout City to understand how it is a title with great potential and concept able to capture the attention of users belonging to all age groups due to immediate and fun gameplay. It remains to be understood how much and how it will be supported by the developers, but the premises leave us optimistic about the future of the game, especially since it seems that the disastrous launch of Rocket Arena has taught EA a lot.

&gt;At launch, Knockout City lacks in content, but it makes up for it with a strong base game and a ton of potential to grow in the future

&gt;On the right map with the right team, you'll encounter some fantastic PVP moments. Though tonally it's more miss than hit, Knockout City is at least worth trying out; but without much variety of content as of review, I'd wait until the game reaches its potential.

&gt;Knockout City has surprised me. It has all the ingredients of a successful multiplayer game: an enjoyable core gameplay mechanic, a high skill ceiling, and the promise of continuous and meaningful support. It’s the type of game I could easily see becoming a popular esport. If you’re after a new competitive online game to play that’s fun and rewards teamwork, be sure to give it a try. If you’re an EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you don’t even need to pay anything for it. Velan Studios has taken the simple concept of dodgeball and turned into one of the most original and enjoyable multiplayer games I’ve played in quite a while.

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Connor Sheridan](https://opencritic.com/critic/1106/connor-sheridan) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/knockout-city-review-you-should-start-downloading-right-now/)

&gt;Clever and unique dodgeball battles make this an easy pick, especially during the free trial.

&gt;It feels like a lot of care has been put into Knockout City. The gameplay offers a satisfying loop, and the amount of customisation is staggering. As time ticks on, Knockout City could prove to be a big hit.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [David Rodriguez](https://opencritic.com/critic/1004/david-rodriguez) - *Spanish* - [76 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-knockout-city-multijugador-competitivo-balon-prisionero-ya-disponible-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-xs-one-switch-pc-869503)

&gt;Knockout City manages to stand out as a multiplayer in the field of gameplay thanks to a different, but familiar premise. Its accessibility invites everyone to participate, but it is in other aspects where it stumbles. A series of business decisions relegate his formula to something fun, but one that could have accomplished much more.

&gt;Knockout City is shockingly, and I say this because it didn't win me over until I got my hands on it, one of my favorite games of 2021. It finds a great balance between crafting a fun adrenaline rush experience that feels so well thought. It's a budget-friendly multiplayer game with ease of access through a free trial and being on game pass,  performance is solid across all platforms, it doesn't dive deep into microtransactions and it's overall a fun time without the toxicity of most modern online shooters. Outside of 1 or 2 bad online connections and perhaps a bit wider player pool game modes, I'm very happy with Knockout City and I can't wait to finish editing this so I can get back to playing.

&gt;It's inexpensive to boot and simple to keep up with, making it markedly less of a chore to log into, have fun with for an hour or two, and hop back out of unlike most service games. It's got a fun style and look to it that makes it all the more inviting, and solid enough mechanics to master that I feel satisfied coming back to practice. Straight up, it's also just fun as hell to play something that isn't so grim or serious, making Knockout City a success in my eyes.

&gt;Charging up a shot is still essential, as that makes it faster, and therefore harder to catch or dodge. A lot of successful Knockout City plays, for me, came down to knowing how long to charge up a shot. At certain close ranges, additional power is unnecessary. But there I was, in close-quarters range, laying on my right trigger out of ... instinct? blind faith that a stronger attack is better? ... while my unarmed opponent caught a lucky rebound and immediately bullseyed me. Other times, I fired way too early from a longer range, which often ended in my shot getting deflected in midair by someone else's throw.

&gt;I was thoroughly impressed with Knockout City. Velan Studios has created a dodgeball game that has solid mechanics and is really easy to pick up. The skill ceiling is also incredibly high, making room for some really competitive gameplay. With a plan to heavily support and add on to the game over time, Knockout City is a welcomed addition to the sports game pantheon.

&gt;‎Knockout City bets on gameplay and fun with a Dogeball game full of personality. Its special map and ball design enriches well-designed gameplay. If you like multiplayer games this will pleasantly surprise you with its style. It is a strong bet within its genre by EA Originals, most of which are coming out on EA Play and Xbox Game Pass.‎

&gt;Knockout City is a fun gameplay experience, but how (and if) it will find a long lasting place in the crowded games as a service market is yet to be seen.

-------------

**[Windows Central](https://opencritic.com/outlet/515/windows-central)** - [Zackery Cuevas](https://opencritic.com/critic/7534/zackery-cuevas) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/knockout-city-pc-review)

&gt;Knockout City is a simple concept that feels great to play, both alone and with friends. It's the kind of live service game you dream of - one that's fun and fair, packed to the gills with unlockables, and thanks to its dedicated team, will only get better over time.

Games,"Like, would capcom be open for the fandom to help crowdfund **Dino Crisis remake.**

Or would square enix be open for the crowdfunding of **Chrono Trigger** for ""Current Gen""(PS5 etc) only? 

I know that crowdfunding in itself isn't enough for the sheer amount of money one would have to dish out to make those projects happen. But what if it could help push those developers/publishers to do it, as it would prove that the fandom shows an interest in that IP?

* One of the customers was a scantily clad woman (I believe).
* There was a pink milkshake and a brown milkshake (and maybe another one?), but they were made on the same machine.
* There were different restaurants (levels) - I believe the first level/restaurant is the burger one.
* There were two kinds of burgers you could cook: a brown one and a white one.
* You had to toast the burger buns in the oven.
* There was lettuce, tomato, onion, and like 2 sauces for the burgers.
* The sauces were on the kitchen island.
* And lastly, for some reason, I distinctly remember there being a trash can.

Games," I’m thinking Arma III of Survival Games. Is there really any out there? So here’s what if played, and these do not fit the category I’m talking about.

Green Hell: Not my cup of tea, wasn’t really worth it. Had to go and eat, after I got done eating. By that time I had to go find some water, when I got finished, needed to eat. 4/10

Stranded Deep: Alright, but still I have to eat and drink every single minute. (not really, it’s not as bad as Green Hell.) but I like this game a whole lot more. Feels more like a survival game, instead of a eating simulator. See: Green Hell. 8/10

Long Dark: I really like this game, I haven’t gotten too far in it yet, but this is as far as I have gotten to a real survival game. Of course, like in the starting screen, it says it’s not trying to be a Survival Simulator, but so far, it’s the best. 10/10

Raft: I mean I guess this game be counted? Eh, not much to say on this. It’s definitely not trying too hard to be a survival game, it’s perfect for someone who isn’t really looking for sim. And I like how it looks  :3 9/10 great game, but still not what I’m looking for. Nothing wrong with it though! (Buy it.)

7 Days to Die: I think I’m just trying to find games that have survival aspects now. But I’m biased to this game. 8/10. Though, still not the simulation I’m looking for.

Minecraft: .... 10/10. Best survival game.. great simulation. Perfect.

Games,"Last month I visited [Angela Game](https://www.angelagame.com/en/contact.html) in Suzhou, China — and it's a very new and professional gaming studio with around 80 developers and some HR/marketing staff. They're producing two games: **Iron Conflict** &amp; **Myth of Empires** — and I was pretty impressed, and it seemed just another example of an honest Chinese company entering the global market through hard work. 

But the more I dig, the more troublesome it seems. Not saying it's Angela Game's whole company at fault, probably just one or two individuals that are \*cheating\*.

First, many of the staff worked at Snail Game before (also in Suzhou, China) and Snail Game was already accused of faking Steam reviews:

* [Is Snail Games faking positive reviews for ARK Park?](https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/8irf28/is_snail_games_faking_positive_reviews_for_ark/)

The first thing my friend noticed about [Iron Conflict on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371480/Iron_Conflict/) too is that the proportion of players to reviews is insanely high (660 players, 550 reviews). And when you look at the reviews, most come from new accounts, which are all favourable reviews.

[This user](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1371480/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_) sums it up:

*Weird how most of the positive reviews are from users who have very generic first names, a handful of games in their accounts, and haven't really ever played anything other than Iron Conflict, which they think is amazing of course. Weird!*

I asked them directly what's up with this but no reply.

And Myth of Empires has been caught with [fake users on their Discord server](https://www.reddit.com/user/Discord-Scandals/comments/nchhyv/myth_of_empires_scandal/), their admin is visible on a [bot-buying website.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Discord-Scandals/comments/nchhyv/myth_of_empires_scandal/)

It's sad to see such a gaming studio lowering itself to these standards. I think the Chinese staff may not even know their abroad-marketing team is doing these 'hacks' — and I'm sure they'll be caught more often in the future.

I absolutely love Terraria and have played it a lot.  Lately my friends have tried getting me into other of those survival craft games, and while I love the concept, there's aspects I dislike.  

What I'm looking for is that survival craft style, but not with the food/drink survival part.  I like the building of a base and crafting gear, but the game also has to have some form of progression.  In Terraria, items and progression were locked behind bosses.  I lately played CryoFall and the game was great, but I never felt like I had to actually go do anything.

Alex did reply, but sadly he didn't actually update the article images to include fixed ones with DOF properly disabled, since it is disabled on his TAAU screenshots which makes the game look much better as depth of field, even when disabled in options, blurs out the character, especially the lace dress.

I did make a mistake in my original post with the wrong scaling command for TAAU, which did make my resized TAAU incorrect (it was actually native rendering size) but the major bug being TAAU disables DOF was also validated when someone linked me to the developer of it on unreal forums: https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/gen-5-temporal-anti-aliasing/152107/5

So big thank you to /u/TechTuts and /u/KeinZantezuken for that (and many others for their *overall* kind comments).

&gt;&gt;  Out of curiosity, will the new TAA upscaling behave well with depth of field? Currently when you set r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=1 , most of the DOF just disappears.

&gt; **So when r.TemporalAA.Upsampling=1, it basically forces r.DOF.Recombine.Quality=0 that looses the slight DOF convolution**, and that is due to DiaphragmDOF.cpp’s bSupportsSlightOutOfFocus. There needs to have some changes in the handling of the slight out of convolution (about 5pixels and below) when doing temporal upsampling that I didn’t have time to come down to. And we were only using temporal upsampling on current gen consoles. **Wasn’t a big deal back then because if your frame would need to be temporally upsampled, that probably meant you didn’t have the performance to run DOF’s slight out of focus**… However we exactly ran into this issue for our Lumen in the Land of Nanite demo running on PS5, but it is still prototype and I’m not sure whether I’m gonna have this finished by 4.26’s release. But yeah given how temporal upsampling is going to become important, it’s definitely something to fix very high on the priority list. 

So basically its expected bug because if someone was using upscaling, they don't want a perf hit from DOF, at least when initially designed.

Here are all of the images in one album: https://imgur.com/a/2tfolwa

All screenshots are @ 3440x1440 with max settings except motion blur disabled and DOF disabled (though in game option doesn't actually disable it as you'll see).

Commands used:

```r.TemporalAA.Upsampling 1``` -- Enable TAAU - This disables FSR as well

```r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0``` -- Disable Depth of Field

```r.ScreenPercentage ###``` -- Set screen percentage. The game uses 77% for Ultra Quality, 67% for Quality, 58% for Balanced and 50% for Performance FSR modes (slider updates when you select). I used the same 4 + 100% for TAAU tests.

I didn't do all the TAAU w/DOF setting enabled since it doesn't make a difference when comparing 100% on vs off and would have just taken more time. As you can see there is no performance difference when disabling it vs disabling it for all other tests. I'd also bumped the mouse and had to re-position it and its slightly off for the last few TAAU tests and the bonus tests.

And for a bonus I did renderScale 120 for FSR UQ and Native, I don't think it actually scaled properly but it did do the sharpening pass for FSR

From the performance being basically equal (it fluctuates few fps) I don't think the ""UQ"" part of FSR was applied at all, which would have scaled it down to 92% or so, so would want to test that in the future with a 100% FSR vs 100% Native as well. I'm glad games like DOTA are allowing users to pick the exact scaling values, excited to see more games integrate that, and hopefully a sharpening slider as well.

Anyway, I hope this helps to clear up any misunderstandings from my first post. I had thrown in FSR / TAAU comparisons quickly but was mostly trying to point out that DOF was broken when TAAU was enabled. Unfortunately Digital Foundries while acknowledging that their testing was flawed, did not correct it, and even originally posted Godfall photos that were also flawed before people called them out on it on twitter. I hope Alex or someone else from Digital Foundries fully corrects the article with updated KingsHunt images and uploads a new video correcting it as well, DOF makes a massive difference in image quality in this game (no clue *why* the devs have the main character out of focus, their lace texture is ruined and it costs performance!).

Another note regarding performance, that would need to be tested for longer, as there is quite a swing in fps while just standing still, the fire/wall effect on the left side of the screen is likely the cause as it is what is changing the most. So while FPS is displayed, it would need to be captured for a while and averaged out to really compare performance between any of the modes as it did swing +- 5-10fps or so.",More FSR / TAAU / DOF Testing with KingsHunt - Detailed IQ Testing with all FSR / TAAU levels - Digital Foundry's TAAU vs FSR Testing was Flawed
Games,"When the pandemic hit, I figured it would be as good a time as any to play some of the games I had always been meaning to play but never got around to. So I decided on my mission: play every main series Legend of Zelda game. And I did it! Took me about 6 months with about 2-3 games per month. And I absolutely loved the journey. I played absolute masterpieces and complete stinkers. But along the way, I got to constantly compare and contrast gameplay, storylines, themes, and many other things. It was an absolute blast, and I'm considering picking another series and doing the same thing.

Have you ever picked a franchise and decided to ""play them all, end-to-end""? If so, which ones? What was worth it, what wasn't? It would be great to hear your experiences!",Which series are fascinating to play the whole way through?
Games,"This game feels absolutely terrible to me. Actual challenging games to me feel like Dark Souls where the game is difficult, but I understand what I did wrong to fail or whatever. With Catherine, it's just mostly the terrible controls and camera that makes it feel really wacky. Most of the time, I want to push the block in front of me forward, but the character ends up pushing another block or doing something entirely bullshitty different than I wanted. 

If I find myself saying ""bullshit"" a hundred times in one section, that's just horrid game design. Maybe it's just the PC version, and no, it's not my controller, so save that argument. It just feels like a very clunky game, and I don't have time to waste on this shit. /rant","Damn, Catherine (on PC at least) is far from a good game..."
Games,"Well i bought the game on sale. I didn't have a ps4 at launch. My kids were using it at college.

I love the story. I hate the core gameplay mechanics. Much Like his last game I cant play any more after hour 5. Also the game has blatant advertisement.  Its like he said Put 95% of the funding from RockStar energy drinks into the story and  cut scenes and umm just add some walking on crappy hills and in rivers to fill t he gap.","Death Stranding , Is it a game?

I quite enjoyed the charm and overlooked it for so long because of how childish it looked as I glossed over the pics. It honestly is very well made and quite a few puzzles had me scratching my head to the point that a little tip guy would appear out of nowhere for a hint.

Games,"#Introduction

With so many games releasing nowadays, I think it's easy for the good ones to get lost in the shuffle. I'm going to list 20 highly anticipated local multiplayer games releasing for the PS4/PS5 some time in the future. This is just a tiny fraction of what’s on the horizon, as the PS4/PS5 receive about 15-20 local multiplayer games a month these days (~17 a month on average from January to June 2020). Most of these games are new, but some are PC ports. **I’m going to order them by release date.** If the game does not have a tangible release date, I’ll place it in the list based on what I think is more likely to come out first, based on marketing material and communication from the developers.

I will also be including links to the Steam page for the game – this is because the Steam page for each individual game has a wealth of information not found on console storefronts. In addition, only the big name games have a store page prior to release on PS4/PS5.

#Games Omitted from the List

* **Street Fighter VI hasn’t been officially announced yet, so it is not on the list. 

* **Samurai Warriors 5** and **Legend of Mana** release next week. I’m just going to include things past the end of Q2 2021 since I’m going to make a post soon about local multiplayer games released in Q2 2021. 

* **Blaster Master Zero 3** releases next month, but the second player will be relegated to a support role like the previous two games. 

* **The Binding of Isaac: Repentance** could also be added to this list, but the original technically already has local co-op – this new DLC is just expanding the roles of the other players to full co-op. It’s meant to come to consoles Q3 2021. 

* **Deathsmiles I &amp; II Collection** releases on December 16, 2021, but right now it’s Japan only. However, the PS4 isn’t region locked so you could order a physical copy and still play it on your non-Japanese console.

* **Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ information is below.**


**0. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands [NOT CONFIRMED]**

* *Release Date:* Early 2022

* *Genre:* First Person Shooter/RPG

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Online Co-op and Possibly Local Co-op

* *Description:* This is a new entry in the Borderlands series, taking place after Borderlands 2 DLC Assault on Dragon Keep. The setting in this game looks to be more fantastical than previous games. As mentioned in the opener, this title is not confirmed to have local co-op, but given Borderlands’ series history, I think there’s a good chance, so I’ll throw it on here with this disclaimer.

#The 50

**1. KeyWe**

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online Co-op

* *Description:* You and a partner play as two postal kiwi workers, in an effort to type out telegrams, send urgent messages, ship packages, and keep the mail flowing. The game evokes that Overcooked-like, time-based co-op experience, and while there have been a ton of imitators since its inception in 2016, this looks to be one of the more unique ones. The game will also be playable in single player.

**2. Kitaria Fables**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/3NGABLR)

* *Description:* Kitaria Fables fuses two genres together in a way that complements one another. You’ll gather, craft, and farm resources that will provide benefits and attributes in battle – all in an effort to dispel the Calamity that has invaded the world.

**3. Hot Wheels Unleashed**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/ALgKyjJ)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDuYs0AhHbE)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1271700/HOT_WHEELS_UNLEASHED/)

* *Release Date:* September 30, 2021

* *Genre:* Racing Game

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local PvP &amp; 12 Player Online PvP

* *Description:* Hot Wheels Unleashed is an ambitious toy-sized racing game from developer Milestone S.r.l., who has previously worked on a number of racing games, including the Ride series. Keeping with the toy theme, this title will allow you to create your own cars and tracks and share them online.

**4. Blood Bowl 3**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/q79qzxD)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1_hgiDAW1g)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016950/Blood_Bowl_3/)

* *Release Date:* September 2021

* *Genre:* Digital Board Game

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online PvP

* *Description:* The original Blood Bowl from 1986 was conceived as a tabletop fantasy football parody, set in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe. Blood Bowl 3 is yet another video game adaptation of the classic tabletop game and is said to “use the latest board game rules and new content.” Blood Bowl (2009) and Blood Bowl 2 (2015) both received favorable review scores, with the second one scoring a 72% on Metacritic for the PS4 version of the game.

**5. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/j0pu50V)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDamisypIi0)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/623280/Dungeons__Dragons_Dark_Alliance/)

* *Release Date:* Summer 2021

* *Genre:* Action RPG

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local Co-op &amp; 4 Player Online Co-op

* *Description:* A spiritual successor to the sixth generation PlayStation 2 games, Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance 1 &amp; 2, this entry wasn’t originally intended to feature local co-op like its inspiration. However, with some fan outcry, developer Tuque Games has decided to add local co-op support via a post-released patch due in the summer. Their tweet only mentions the PS5, XBSX, and PC however – so it’s possible the PS4 and XBO versions will not receive this update.

**6. Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/Jq2MzZL)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSkq1qzhD3U)

* *PlayStation Store Page:* [Link](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA01668_00-FLASH20000000005)

* *Release Date:* October 5, 2021

* *Genre:* 3D Platformer/Mini-Game Collection

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local Co-op &amp; PvP

* *Description:* This is a collection of the first three Super Monkey Ball games with 12 mini-games included and apparently 4 player local co-op. Co-op implies working together through a series of levels – the originals only had the versus mini-game mode, so this would be a massive inclusion to the mix. There will be more than 300 stages from the first three games, and it’s unknown what levels will be playable in local co-op, but hopefully it’s all of them!

**7. The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/6o6chKh)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-3Ev3HQQV4)

* *Steam Page:* N/A

* *Release Date:* October 22, 2021

* *Genre:* Interactive Narrative Game

* *Multiplayer:* 5 Player Local Co-op &amp; 2 Player Online Co-op

* *Description:* This comes from the developer behind Until Dawn, and it’s the third game in the The Dark Anthology series. As the series’ name implies, this is not connected to the previous games, so no worries jumping in on this entry as your starting point. This game will feature a military unit in the ruins of a Sumerian Temple, unearthing some otherworldly monstrosities. Like the previous games, you will make narrative choices that impact the story.

**8. Conan Chop Chop**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/uvbnDZg)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEZSmZQqSwg)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061880/Conan_Chop_Chop/)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Roguelite/Top Down Hack &amp; Slash

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local &amp; Online Co-op

* *Description:* Set in the mythical land of Hyboria, Conan Chop Chop will feature various classes, a randomly generated world, and large-scale boss fights. This is an official entry in the Conan universe and will be published by Funcom like the previous games.

**9. 30XX**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/VROn5IX)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Vqdmoe8to)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029210/30XX/)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Roguelite/2D Action Platformer

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online Co-op

* *Description:* 30XX is the sequel to 2014’s 20XX. This is a Mega Man X inspired roguelite with both local and online co-op. There were eight characters with different abilities to play as in 20XX, and it looks like a similar approach is kept for the sequel. Despite taking place 1000 years after the original, Ace and Nina at least, are still present in 30XX.

**10. Tunche**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/NK2NneB)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azQRZ2ADbuE)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/887450/Tunche/)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Roguelite/Beat ‘em Up

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* Tunche is set in the Amazonian jungle which gives it a different flavor than most other roguelites out there. There will be five selectable characters, each will their own skills sets and ultimate abilities, with new, unlockable abilities throughout the course of the game. Hat Kid from A Hat in Time will also be featured as a playable character.

**11. Heavenly Bodies**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/yjTueWN)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLIA4Jm8JfI)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1138850/Heavenly_Bodies/)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Co-op Focused Physics-based Adventure

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* Heavenly Bodies follows two cosmonauts in the 1970s who must work together through a series of physics-based challenges. While the game is built around the co-op experience, the game can still be played in single player. While this is only local co-op at the moment, the Steam page seems to suggest that the developer is looking into options for online play.

**12. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/W9JSS9d)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibDx3ueg90U)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117850/Cuphead__The_Delicious_Last_Course/)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Run &amp; Gun

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* This is technically a DLC, but given the wait for it, I think it’s fair to expect a fairly sizeable one. This DLC will introduce a new playable character, Ms. Chalice, who will have a double jump and possibly other differentiating moves. This DLC was originally supposed to release in 2019, but it’s been delayed a number of times. For reference, the original game released in 2017 and took seven years to make (though the two brothers responsible for the game had day jobs and a much smaller team up until 2014).

**13. Dawn of the Monsters**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/zaikZfD)

* *Gameplay Footage:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pm-TSp42IU)

* *Steam Page:* N/A

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Beat ‘em Up

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* From the creators of Runbow comes a unique looking beat ‘em up with playable Godzilla-sized monsters, in a trek through four major metropolitan areas: from Toronto to Tokyo. The game will feature 2.5D graphics, an in depth combat system, RPG upgrades, and fully destructible environments.

**14. Curse of the Sea Rats**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/I8XGv6v)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq995S7Jj3c)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1453900/Curse_of_the_Sea_Rats/)

* *Release Date:* 2022

* *Genre:* Metroidvania

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* With hand-drawn animations and 3D environments, Curse of the Sea Rats looks to be one of the most visually interesting games due out this year. The game will feature four playable characters, upgradable abilities, four player local co-op, and a 12 hour story.

**15. Party Animals**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/uk5HshK)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo0airOqCjc)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260320/Party_Animals/)

* *Release Date:* 2022

* *Genre:* 3D Physics-based Brawler

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local &amp; 8 Player Online Multiplayer

* *Description:* Anyone who’s played Gang Beasts can instantly see where Party Animals takes its inspiration. It looks to invoke the same hilarity and simplicity seen in that game. Gang Beasts allowed for combo multiplayer (2+ players on the same system playing online together), so I’m hoping for the same thing here.

**16. Salt and Sacrifice**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/RR0wQqZ)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnBkp9ascxc)

* *Steam Page:* N/A

* *Release Date:* 2022

* *Genre:* 2D Souls-like RPG/Metroidvania

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online Co-op &amp; Likely PvP

* *Description:* This is a sequel to Salt and Sanctuary and my personal most anticipated local co-op game. While Salt and Sanctuary was local co-op only, the sequel has expanded the scope of the project to include online play as well. The original featured a variety of classes and 20-30 hours’ worth of content, so here’s hoping for the same or more from this new entry. The original had the ability to fight against another your co-op partner, and while this hasn’t been confirmed, I think there’s a good chance it will return.

**17. Dark Envoy**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/Vfbwf9O)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnCjAWkAj4)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346010/RiMS_Racing/)

* *Release Date:* 2022

* *Genre:* Action RPG

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online Co-op &amp; PvP

* *Description:* Dark Envoy comes from developer Event Horizon, who previously released Tower of Time in 2018, scoring a 77% on Metacritic for the PC version of the game – though it seems the console ports had some technical issues, lowering their scores. Tower of Time featured a ~35 hour story and ~50 hours of content, and Dark Envoy looks to be even more ambitious. Dark Envoy will feature 15 unique character classes, non-linear gameplay, and plenty of side quests. In addition to the co-op campaign, there will also be a Player vs World Mode, in which one player controls the final boss and must destroy the other player before they become too powerful. This could end being the biggest hit or the biggest miss on the list, depending on how the console ports are handled.

**18. River City Girls 2**

* *Picture:* [Picture of the First Game](https://imgur.com/a/fgPNhcK)

* *Trailer:* [Trailer for the First Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ZyztIMKDs)

* *Steam Page:* N/A

* *Release Date:* 2022

* *Genre:* Beat ‘em Up

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online Co-op

* *Description:* River City Girls 2 was announced on Twitter by WayForward, the developer behind Shantae, with only promotional art accompanying the announcement. While not much is known, River City Girls 2 will feature more playable characters and add online play to the mix (local play was already in the original). The original River City Girls achieved a 79% on Metacritic for the PS4 version of the game.

**19. Cassette Beasts**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/BzvSEOK)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/)

* *Release Date:* “Coming Soon”

* *Genre:* Pokemon-like Turn-Based RPG

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* From the creators of Lenna's Inception, Bytten Studio, which released on Steam in January 2020 – a randomly generated Zelda inspired local co-op action adventure game with two art styles to switch between. The two guys behind the game have also worked on Starbound, Stardew Valley, and Wargroove, so they have quite a pedigree of games. Cassette Beasts in heavily inspired by Pokemon and includes 120 beasts that can be combined for a total of 14,400 fusions.

**20. DEFLECTION: Laser Chess**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/PJ9jdev)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517240/DEFLECTION_Laser_Chess//)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Digital Board Game

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local &amp; Online PvP

* *Description:* There have been spins on chess as a game, and in recent years there’s been a plethora of indie games that twist the formula even further. The great thing about taking a classic like Chess and adding a twist is that a lot of people already understand the basic rules, so it’s not as intimidating to learn as some other digital board games or strategy games. DEFLECTION: Laser Chess looks to incorporate distance and lasers as the main hook, with mirrors, disruptors, and portals that can be incorporated into one’s strategy.

**21. Windjammers 2**

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/0nMNfBU)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEFU-Y_vec)

* *Steam Page:* [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114290/Windjammers_2//)

* *Release Date:* 2021

* *Genre:* Indie Sports

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Competitive Local &amp; Online Multiplayer

* *Description:* Windjammers is a fast paced blend between pong and frisbee that originally came out in 1994. An updated version of the game was released for modern consoles with online play, and Windjammers 2 will be a new sequel 27 years after the original release. Players can choose between a multitude of characters with different stats, with a few mini games to boot.

**22. OddBallers**

* *Release Date:* TBD

* *Genre:* Indie Sports

* *Multiplayer:* 6 Player Local &amp; Online Competitive Multiplayer

* *Description:* This is the spiritual successor to Stikbold. It’s a dodgeball game with wacky antics and multiple game modes. Players can do free for all or team based matches, and if it’s anything like Stikbold, it will also have a two player local co-op campaign with a few boss fights.

**23. Samurai Gunn 2**

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ_I8SSVKto)

* *eShop Page:* [Link](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/samurai-gunn-2-switch//)

* *Release Date:* TBD

* *Genre:* Arena Fighter

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local Co-op/4 Player Competitive Local Multiplayer

* *Description:* Samurai Gunn 2 is the sequel to the 2013 PC exclusive. The game is designed by Beau Blyth, the co-creator behind Hyper Light Drifter. The game plays similarly to TowerFall, in that you platform around a fixed screen and try to shoot the other players. The sequel will launch exclusively on Switch first, with a release for other platforms in the future. The story mode will allow for up to two players in local co-op, while the competitive mode will allow up to four.

* *Genre:* Co-op-focused Physics-based Racing/3D Platformer

* *Multiplayer:* Local &amp; Online Multiplayer

* *Description:* Tethered together by an elastic rope, players will bounce, roll, and fling their way to the finish line. The game allows you to share your controller with your partner, but separate controllers are also supported. This looks like a weird blend of those 8 player mini-games from Mario Party 7 and Iggy’s Wrecking Balls.

* *Release Date:* To Be Announced

* *Genre:* Run &amp; Gun

* *Multiplayer:* Local &amp; Online Co-op

* *Description:* The Behemoth is best known for Castle Crashers, but one of their earlier works was Alien Hominid – one of the first indie games on consoles, first releasing in 2004 (not counting the smaller scale 2002 Newsgrounds version). Alien Hominid Invasion will feature randomly generated levels, selectable modifiers, and a nonlinear game path.

* *Genre:* 2D Puzzle Platformer

* *Multiplayer:* Local Co-op Only

* *Description:* Sporting the appearance of a traditional 2D platformer, Toodee and Topdee allows you to change the camera perspective to modify the level. Given the back and forth between the two characters, it seems like this game will work great whether in single player or multiplayer.

* *Release Date:* 2022

* *Genre:* Party Game

* *Multiplayer:* To Be Determined

* *Description:* The original Mario + Rabbids had a separate local co-op mode. It is unknown if it will be returning with this new entry, but the fact that the eShop page didn’t just default to 1 player makes me think it will.

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local, Online, &amp; Combo Multiplayer

* *Description:* This new entry is a compilation of 100 selected mini-games from previous Mario Party games, with five boards selected from the three Nintendo 64 games. [Having watched GameXPlain’s breakdown of the 60 mini-games we know of so far,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6RiO4fgyVY) I’m pretty happy with the selection from the ones we know of. Unlike Super Mario Party, you will be able to use a Pro Controller and button controls for this game.

* *Release Date:* Fall 2021

* *Genre:* Racing Game

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local PvP

The last console Cruis’n game was released in 2007 for the Wii to abysmal reviews, though that entry was actually developed as a The Fast and the Furious game before being switched to Cruis’n after losing the license mid-production.

This remake comprises the two GameBoy Advance games and is the series’ first console release, not counting Famicom Wars or Battalion Wars. The art style has been changed from sprites to a more chibi look, which will be hit or miss for some people.

* *Genre:* Party Game

* *Multiplayer:* 4 Player Local Multiplayer

* *Description:* This is the first new WarioWare entry on consoles since Smooth Moves for the Wii in 2006 (2007 in the West), although 2013’s Game &amp; Wario for the Wii U could also be considered depending on who you ask. While old WarioWare games did feature local multiplayer support, a lot of the content was asynchronous (handing off to another player when it’s their turn), whereas this new entry will allow at least 2 players to go at it at the same time.

* *Genre:* Action/Strategy RPG

* *Multiplayer:* 2 Player Local Co-op

* *Description:* Death Thrash is the work of one developer over the course of five years and looks to evoke Lovecraftian horror elements and oldschool RPG conventions, with a modern twist. The second player will have their own character, stats, inventory, and the like, but quest progression will be shared between the two players. The game will feature both shared-screen and split-screen support, so you can seemingly separate from one another to a certain degree much like Divinity: Original Sin 2.

**40. The King of Fighters XV**

Games,"While there are numerous people on my Twitter feed discussing this right now, I'll just cherry-pick two threads from Leffen:

[https://twitter.com/TSM\_Leffen/status/1412509571172687872](https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1412509571172687872)

I am not a TO, but I'll do my best to bring up the biggest hurdles to a PC-run local as I understand them.

Of course, cost is a factor.  You could probably have a machine capable of running Mortal Kombat 11 (which I'm guessing is the most demanding fighting game right now) quite well for under $750, once we get back to a world where paying MSRP for graphics cards is a thing again.  That's not a trivial additional cost per tournament station over getting a PlayStation or Xbox, but at least it would come with the benefit of having access to far more games being playable on it, especially through emulation, and almost all of them running with less latency, even if it's barely less latency.  Perhaps a thriftier PC enthusiast who builds them more often than me (once every 5 years) could beat my estimate of $750.  Is this additional cost untenable, or am I just a bad shopper?

Hot swapping inputs is definitely a problem with PC fighting games.  Has anyone tried [a program like dhc](https://twitter.com/lofi1048/status/1412481249688670208)?  I know that as recently as this past weekend, two friends and myself had issues switching between a Qanba Q1 (PS3 format), a hitbox built on a Brook Universal Fighting Board, and a Hori Fighting Commander pad on Guilty Gear Strive PC.  We could only ever get two of the controllers recognized by the game at a time, and our best chance for success was to shut down the game and boot it back up with only two of the controllers plugged in, even though the controller select screen listed 3 inputs.  To solve this problem, is an external program like the one I listed the best answer?  Or should it fall on the operating system's shoulders?  Or should it fall on the game developer to account for these inputs across every new game?  All I know is that I'm guessing it shouldn't be the developer, because that sounds like everyone's doing a lot of re-work.

How about setting up the machine?  Perhaps you could image and clone an OS installed with the latest drivers, the games you want to have at the ready, and automatic updates disabled to prevent disruptive shenanigans.  At that point, you'd basically just need a Steam login to authenticate each machine.  Is there anything that could be learned from competitive scenes in other PC games here, like Counter-Strike, Fortnite, Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, Dota 2, or League of Legends?  How do those scenes handle this, and is there some reason that couldn't possibly apply here?

What do you folks think?  Hopefully no one's so adamant that it couldn't be done, especially since if fighting games *could* have less latency on console, they would.  So to solve this problem, it's got to be PC.  But what would have to change about the logistics of PC to make this viable?  If we can complain loudly enough to make rollback and crossplay a thing, perhaps we can get the right people to step up to solve these problems too.",Guilty Gear Strive's additional input delay on PlayStation has the FGC discussing the pros and (many) cons of running offline tournaments on PCs.

&gt;Monster hunter Stories 2 is one of the great titles of this year and can choose to be a great JRPG much remembered, a title with a good story where we do not play the role of a hunter but a raider and what this entails, followed by a great Turn-based system that every player of the genre will love. A more than essential proposal that I recommend adding to the summer cart.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is somewhat imperfect, but the flaws don’t quite eclipse its strengths. Despite the annoying party AI and grind, the combat has the right level of tactical depth I would expect from a turn-based Monster Hunter game. With its adorable Monsties and a wide-open world to explore, gamers looking for a new JRPG to dive into can certainly do a lot worse. As long as you are prepared for some irritating supporting cast members and a somewhat repetitive gameplay loop, fans of the monster-collecting genre will get a lot out of this game.

&gt;Masterful storytelling, building on the successful elements from the first game and amplifying the diversity available in gene mechanics all help make Monster Hunter Stories 2 a top-class RPG for Nintendo Switch. Aside from the poogies' absence and minor issues, there is no doubt that both returning and new fans will dive into monster hunting being impressed by the attention to detail in game design and execution that makes it accessible and highly enjoyable. It is a must buy game, and it can only be hoped that one day there will be another released to make it a trilogy.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a much friendlier introduction to the complex franchise, anchored by excellent turn-based RPG combat,

&gt;In fact, I went into this expecting little more than a second-tier spinoff from the “real” Monster Hunter, and I’ve walked away with it being one of my favourite JRPGs of the year, in a year that has included Bravely Default 2, NieR, Atelier Ryza 2, and Scarlet Nexus. That is some incredible company to be in.

&gt;Hardcore Monster Hunter fans might turn their nose at Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin’s sheer straight to the point approach to gameplay, but what it goes for is done surprisingly well, and folks who find themselves intimidated by the still high barrier of entry to the main entries might find it a good entry point into the series. It’s got basically every trait from what characterizes a Monster Hunter in one easy to digest JRPG formula.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a solid turn-based monster collector that still manages to feel like a Monster Hunter game. If you're a fan of games like Pokemon Sword and Shield, or you just can't get enough Monster Hunter, you'll definitely want to check out this game.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is very much so a Monster Hunter game. Its main focus still falls on the core loop of battling monsters, gathering materials, and using them to craft badass gear suited for different situations. Infused with a rock-paper-scissors turn-based combat system and creature collection elements, it does, nevertheless, provide a different spin on things that adds extra reasons to sink your teeth into its inherent grind.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a mixed bag. Hatching and maxing out your Monsties is a lot of fun, but the battle system in which you spend most of your time eventually wears out its welcome. While the story becomes interesting in the late game, it takes a long time to get there, with extended periods spent wandering from quest point to quest point on autopilot. There are a lot of systems at play here, but they don't always gel into a compelling game.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a great and charming RPG with a similar, addicting gameplay loop as the main series. While the game drags a little in the middle, it's worth seeing through to the end and beyond.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a complete game that serves its purpose to dazzle veterans and newbies. Although it has errors, its visual style, its combat and its successes when it comes to capturing the essence of the classic JRPG make this game a recommendable title.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin breathes new life into the world of Monster Hunter. The shift to a turn-based RPG is handled so well, with an addictive and fast-paced combat system that's just as rewarding as traditional Monster Hunter. Complementing that is a genuinely engaging story full of wonderful characters, all rendered in an incredibly beautiful art style. Whether you're a newcomer or a series veteran, this is a must-play RPG.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin deserves to find a sizable audience. It's full of charm and boasts depth that can immerse the committed or be dabbled with by those eager to simply experience the story. As a blend of Monster Hunter with a traditional RPG approach it's an accomplished effort, and offers the sort of meaty experience that'll keep most players busy for weeks. Switch owners will need to tolerate some disappointing performance, unfortunately, but the overall experience shines nonetheless. It's a game of bright colours and wholehearted optimism, which is very welcome indeed.Oh, and you can name your Monsties; trust us, you're gonna love these companions.

&gt;That said, Stories 2 might end up being the game I get the closest to a ""perfect game"" in. There's plenty to play with here, and honestly I'd like to double back and check out the original to fill in some of the gaps in the story. This JRPG July is off to a pretty good start.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is an amazing JRPG that offers an exceptional monster collecting experience combined with a great story. The added narrative doesn’t lose focus on what makes the Monster Hunter series so addictive and only enhances the experience. This game successfully built on the systems present in the original and improved them for a brand new adventure. While the performance can be questionable, I enjoyed every second of my time exploring the world with my Monsties by my side.

&gt;While the repetitiveness of its turn-based battle system can become frustrating, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is more than a novel twist on the main series' core components.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is even more enjoyable than the original. Small and meaningful improvement build on the same addictive formula and rewarding battle system, with an endearing story to boot that'll hook in any fan of the franchise. The current state of the Switch version is a shame, but if you can get past the problems, Wings of Ruin has a lot to offer.

&gt;Once in a while, you come across a game that surprises you in the most pleasant ways. Monster Hunter Stories 2 went above and beyond my expectations for the sequel with its wonderful visuals as well as a story with plenty of heart, poignancy as well as some good old fun thrown in between. It’s obvious that a great amount of effort was put in this game and it shows. Given how the first game underperformed, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a game that shouldn’t have been made. Thank goodness that it was.

&gt;. If Monster Hunter Stories 2 allowed the player full control over the party and made it more about customizing a team, then the overall experience would make it an excellent entry in the franchise. Even without, it's a very good turn-based monster collector with broad appeal that's worth a look for fans of the genre.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2 is not only a friendly way to ease into an otherwise imposing series. It’s also an example of a developer improving upon every flaw from the original game. The result is a game that is one of the best I’ve played so far in 2021.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin it's a little more than a ""more of the same"". The story, like the Monsties, are fun and engaging, but don't expect a masterpiece unless you're an hardcore Monster Hunter fan.

&gt;Fans of the Monster Hunter series – even the main games – will have a real hit on their hands here, with a pleasant change of pace from the usual Monster Hunter antics. That doesn’t mean that there’s not plenty here for the layman too, and if you’re looking for a fun, if a bit easy, title to run you through to that huge release window in October than this is definitely worthy of your consideration.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2 turns out to be a good JRPG that will delight fans of the saga, especially those willing to turn a blind eye to its undeniable ease and a narrative held back by avalanches of fetch quests and a disappointing protagonist. Those who have played the first game should keep in mind that this is a more of the same, with all the pros and cons that this entails.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a great JRPG that blends the spirit of Monster Hunter with turn-based combat and exploration. The central story is good, but it's the loot loop and party building that really draws you in. It may not represent a huge leap forward from the original game, but this is a fantastic title for fans of either the main Monster Hunter series or JRPGs in general.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a win, with so many quality of life changes from its predecessor on 3DS. It’s welcoming and accessible, familiar yet new, complex but not too confusing, and has plenty of surprises waiting for players and I can see myself playing it way beyond this review.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a much better game than I could have ever anticipated. It’s a very clever spin on the Monster Hunter formula, with a cutesy art style, turn-based combat that is easy to pick up regardless of your experience with RPG games, a serviceable story, and more than enough depth and sidequests to keep you busy for hours.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a fun, anime-inspired ride that gets better the further you delve in. It has a huge roster of Monsties to tame, a simple to learn but difficult to master combat system, and an insanely addictive Monstie development system.

&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a charming and enjoyable little RPG that is geared toward Monster Hunter fans who are looking for something with a slower pace. The story and tone may be a tad childish for some, but it works well for the characters. The strong core combat system buoys some lackluster dungeons and a generic story. It's a chill RPG for Monster Hunter fans and a pretty good introduction to the franchise for newcomers, especially younger children who may be frustrated by a traditional Monster Hunter title.

Games,"RESUBMITTED AFTER MOD APPROVAL

Hey all,

I wanted to discuss a problem I've been facing recently as someone who is trying to get into using fightsticks, and bring awareness to the current situation as a PS5+Fightstick player.

I primarily wanted one for Guilty Gear Strive on Ps5, and I thought simply if it worked on Ps4, itd work on Ps5 obviously right? Well, its complicated. Currently, only OFFICIALLY LISCENCED Ps4 fightsticks will work with PS5 versions of fighting games (Guilty Gear, MK11). That means if you want to use your Hitbox controller in the PS5 version of Guilty Gear (with faster loading and increased resolution) you're out of luck. You're stuck playing the PS4 version, and if you bought the PS5 version, you're stuck to the DualSense.

After a lot of research, I settled on a secondhand MadCatz TE-S+ in good condition, one of the very few officially licensed Playstation 4 sticks that work natively with PS5. This stick is not even made or supported anymore, and the other ones that are compatible are very expensive outside the $80 Qanba Drone. (Qanba Obsidian, Victrix Pro)

This kind of concerns me for future sticks on PS5. If only the officially liscenced sticks work with PS5 now, then is this how it will be with PS5 moving forward? I would say most sticks are unlicensed, and having to have all manufacturers license the Playstation branding just to make a arcade stick is going to drive prices up for PS Users.

Street Fighter 5 and Tekken 7 are both still PS4 games, so many whom use sticks with these can still use them fine on PS5. But, whenever Tekken 8 or Street Fighter 6 come out, as of right now, everyone is going to have to get new sticks or boards to put into their sticks. Unliscenced PS3 sticks worked fine on PS4 after a software update, why have they made this mistake again?

This is all in stark contrast to Xbox Series X, which universally works with any sticks that would have worked before on Xbox One. There are Xbox branded sticks, but you're are not beholden to them on that system
Not even Brook's Universal Fighting Board work on PS5 native games yet, and that works on everything, including Xbox Series X games.

I'm hoping this doesn't turn into another proprietary thing for Sony, as they have done this before (VITA Memory, UMD) As I mentioned, It would unnecessarily drive up the cost of arcade sticks for PS5, when we should be making the barrier of entry for new stick players lower.","Discussing PS5 compatibility issues with Fightstick controllers, and concerns over potential ""licensing"" problems."
Games,"I played on a MUD, between, I think, the years 1987 and 1989, using the character name ""Games"".

This MUD had different Admin (they use to be called Gods) created areas in the game, each of which would have some quest.   One area, was Bard related or something, and it had a ""Sunsword"".

Also I believe your character would lose all their equipment, everytime the game rebooted, but then all the areas would be reset.   I remember always running to grab the ""Sunsword"" after a game reboot, and the administrator (God in the game) got annoyed at me, because it was a needed item in the quest for his area.

There were not many MUDs around at that time, anyone have any idea, what the name of this MUD was called?   I want to remember for my gaming resume.",Trying to Figure Out What the Name of this Game from the Late 1980s.

&gt;In theory, motion control of the Nintendo Switch paired with The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD is a perfect match. What sounds quite conclusive at first has unfortunately not been implemented perfectly in practice. A further complication is the optics, which no longer meet today's standards despite HD.

&gt;A faithful remake of the most polarising 3D Zelda title, Skyward Sword HD provides numerous quality of life improvements that help polish some of the original’s roughest edges. Its issues with pacing, repetitive gameplay elements, and a lacklustre narrative remain moderate detractions from what is an otherwise legendary Zelda experience, filled to the brim with the charisma, creativity, and satisfying dungeoneering the series is famous for. While it doesn’t bring any new content to the table, the addition of button controls and portability (courtesy of the Switch) means there’s never been a better way for newcomers and diehard fans to experience the strategic combat and innovative puzzle-solving of this lofty adventure.

&gt;The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD is a constant fight between good and evil : if the game now makes the most of the 60 fps/HD display and a mostly muted Fi, the classic controls are not easily transposables to a simple controller, and most of the already-outdated game design flaws of the 2011 game are still there.

&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD makes great efforts to improve the original to make it the definitive way to play the series' origin story. Whilst the game's initially poor pacing has improved, the game can still be slightly tedious and repetitive. Putting that aside, the dungeon design, item ingenuity, and some of the boss battles are series highlights that no Zelda fan should miss.

&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an absolutely incredible game so if you haven't played it yet, this HD iteration makes for a great excuse to finally give it a go. Those who still own it on Wii might want to hold out, though, because it's surely not a huge step up.

&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD is a conservative update to one of Link's less-heralded adventures that's unlikely to change many minds one way or the other. The padding, control limitations, and other issues fans have long bemoaned are still in full effect. That said, there's really no such thing as a bad Zelda game, and this one still shines at times thanks to a strong story, excellent dungeons, and some intense boss battles. If you're impatient for Breath of the Wild 2 and have never played Skyward Sword, by all means, give the game a shot, just keep your expectations slightly grounded.

Games,"Super Stay Forever is a German-language podcast examining noteworthy console titles and what made them remarkable. Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader is the subject of [the latest episode](https://podcastd45a61.podigee.io/236-neue-episode) and one of the co-hosts has recently interviewed Julian Eggebrecht, co-founder of Factor 5 and game director of Rogue Leader. Excerpts of the interview are interspersed throughout the podcast, there’s a particularly interesting tidbit around 26 minutes in. According to Eggebrecht, Microsoft made an offer around September 2000 to get Factor 5 and LucasArts to turn Rogue Leader into an Xbox exclusive, once they had seen the Spaceworld 2000 demo.

*“[Microsoft] saw the demo and contacted LucasArts immediately, saying: ‘We want to snatch this title away from Nintendo.’ […] Around that time, it wasn’t apparent yet that Halo would end up becoming the launch title that it turned out to be and Microsoft was still looking for a killer-exclusive launch title, since they had no equivalent to Mario. Around September 2000, we met at the Factor 5 offices and Microsoft gave us the entire Xbox pitch. Then LucasArts went: ‘Okay, we’ll make you [Factor 5] an offer that you can’t refuse. We want you to inform Nintendo that Rogue Leader will become an Xbox-exclusive instead.’ At the time, we were an official Nintendo design partner and effectively helped to conceive the GameCube. Thus, their proposal was unthinkable for us. Especially because we were hoping to receive a first-party license from Nintendo and to be able to develop proper Nintendo titles, which is why from our point of view, the proposal was nuts. So I said: ‘This sounds good and all, but [Rogue Leader] will be a GameCube launch title and we can figure out how to release it on Xbox afterwards, but we’ll need to maintain a degree of exclusivity for Nintendo.’ LucasArts then re-entered negotiations with Nintendo. Nintendo had titles of their own, so they were willing to bargain with LucasArts and offer them a beneficial deal, but obviously not as good a deal as Microsoft had offered, since Microsoft had offered them a whole lot more money. Things got increasingly more uncomfortable and around Christmas that year, Nintendo put pressure on LucasArts, and LucasArts told us that they would cancel Rogue Leader and their entire relationship with us, which was obviously a bluff, unless you agree tomorrow to develop the game as an Xbox-exclusive instead and tell Nintendo to say goodbye to their exclusive. […] This was one of two instances where it felt like our relationship with LucasArts had come to an end and we were like: ‘Take a look at everything we did for you, we just made your most lucrative title, you’ve got crazy momentum because of the Spaceworld 2000 demo, so could you at least take our side on this, since we were the ones who made the whole thing possible in the first place, and not throw us to the wolves like that?’ Especially with a Japanese company involved, who would never have talked to us again, if the Microsoft deal had happened. […] I talked to everyone at Factor 5 about how to proceed. I said: ‘Let’s talk to LucasArts and call their bluff. In my opinion, they can’t afford to miss out on this title altogether, they definitely can’t develop it in-house because they don’t have the people with the technical chops, so I’ll just call them tomorrow and tell them to jump in a lake.’ That’s what we decided on, and we sat down with LucasArts the next day and I said: ‘It’s either our way or the highway’ and told them they had 24 hours to decide. I added that we had Nintendo’s financial support and we’d just develop a first-party title for them instead. Also, we had a contract for three titles with LucasArts, without a clause enabling them to choose which platform to release on, so we would sue them. Around 24 hours later, LucasArts called and said: ‘Okay, we’ll release Rogue Leader on GameCube.’”* (paraphrased)

In another excerpt from the interview towards the end of the podcast, Eggebrecht reveals that Factor 5 was intrigued with the online capabilities of the original Xbox and intended to release a Rogue Squadron collection containing ports of Rogue Leader and Rebel Strike on the system, but the collection was scrapped.","According to Julian Eggebrecht (co-founder of Factor 5), Microsoft tried to turn Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader into an Xbox-exclusive instead"

Games,"(Im keeping this discussion in relation to single player games only)

I have recently completed Dragon Age Inquisition, Kingdom Come Deliverance and I’m currently playing Assassins Creed Odyssey. All of these RPGs have wasted/disrespected my time IMO.

I will start with Odyssey as this is fresh in my mind and has recently pissed me off. Now I’ve played Ubisoft games before and generally know what to expect. Solid story in a beautiful but shallow open world.

This was my first AC in years with the last one I played being Black Flag. The story itself is interesting but never has a game made it so difficult for me to enjoy it. Every time I’m about to reach an interesting point in the story my goal is pushed further away from reach. 

Either I’m sent on a fetch quest to find an item in a fort or camp. Or I’m told the person I’m looking for is someone else. Even after meeting the person of interest I first have to 3 side quests before getting the information i need. And unfortunately the quality 

Greece is absolutely beautiful landscape. It’s probably the best looking open world I’ve ever played in. But unfortunately it’s size ends up being a nuisance. You have to sail, trek, or horse-ride very long distances to complete quests. This may be  inherent issue in most open world games but this games insurmountable size make one yearn for a fun traversal system.

While the older AC games had their issues I never felt any barriers stopping me from doing the main story.

Now Dragon Age Inquisition is less of an offender as it’s not too difficult to grind power and proceed through the main quest. But has the same issue as its priority is quantity over quality. With a vast array of poor side content such as odyssey. Interesting side quests are replaced with generic activities.

Kingdom Come Deliverance wastes your time with some of its game mechanics. Some people have problems with its survival elements but those don’t bother me. What annoys me greatly is the real life time the games wastes unnecessarily. Jail Time of 10 days wastes about 5min of my time in real life. Just sitting a waiting for the time to finish. Fast travel also has no business calling itself fast. While the system is interesting, there is absolutely no reason for Henry’s movement speed to be so slow when moving on the map. 

Sorry that this is kind of a rant, but this has made me appreciate linear titles a lot more.",Some games don’t respect the players time enough

&gt;Cyanide Studios have proven their mettle with previous games in the supernatural genre. Their previous efforts include Styx: Shards of Darkness and the Call of Cthulhu. Both games were well received. Earthblood is a solid effort that should get werewolf fans howling with glee.

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood has a lot of interesting ideas, but the boring and repetitive gameplay and lack of compelling story mean it fails to make a lasting impression.

&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series X gamers have been yearning for a cracking werewolf video game and, while this delivers in the combat stakes, it's dull RPG elements slow down the action

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood proudly wears the reverence for White Wolf's lore on its furry sleeve, with a dark-but-interesting universe and a fierce pro-environment/anti-capitalist message. But behind its wild, bloody carnage and well-meant intentions lies a dated and sorely repetitive stealth adventure that, among its contemporaries, fails to stand out from the pack.

&gt;Fun at times but also scruffy and repetitive, Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood lacks a bit of bite.

-------------

&gt;One of the best AA games to release in quite some time, Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood combines brutal combat, smart stealth and a well-developed lore into a 20 hour long action adventure campaign. It can get a little repetitive before the midpoint but there’s some excellent moments waiting for those that can push through to the end.

&gt;Playing as an angry werewolf is fun for a minute, but loses its way through heavy repetition

&gt;A fun but incredibly flawed hybrid of stealth and hack-and-slash which plays like something dug out from the bargain bin of 2009.

&gt;As if suffering from some bizarre form of virtual Stockholm Syndrome, I felt nearly compelled to see Earthblood through. The game ended up more entertaining because of the barebones effort put into it, resulting in humorous bugs, glitches, and just plain nonsense.

**[GameSpew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew)** - [Richard Seagrave](https://opencritic.com/critic/2754/richard-seagrave) - [6 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2021/02/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-review/)

&gt;The power you feel upon becoming a half-man, half-wolf monstrosity in Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood is its saving grace. There’s nothing else out there that offers a similar experience. Sure, it gets a bit repetitive, but you’re a freaking werewolf, capable of picking up a grown man and ripping his head clean off. Boss fights are a highlight, too, actually putting your combat skills to the test, unlike the majority of battles where soldiers are thrown into the arena like lambs to the slaughter. Like its protagonist, Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood has many sides to it that are all rough around the edges, but it’s not totally devoid of charm.

&gt;Good voice acting and cool, bloody werewolf fighting sequences could not fully save the rushed story and flat facial animations of this one-dimensional take on the rich World of Darkness universe.

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse Earthblood is an old-school action game launching in a very modern arena. Its simplicity in design may not appeal to everyone, but for those looking for a basic stealth and combat action-adventure, there's a lot to love about the latest dive into the World of Darkness.

-------------

**[GamesBeat](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat)** - [Jason Wilson](https://opencritic.com/critic/1059/jason-wilson) - [3 / 5 stars](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/04/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-review/)

&gt;When I think of games from Spiders, Cyanide, Piranha Bytes, or Reality Pump, I appreciate how often ambition overcomes limited resources. Their games (such as Gothic, Two Worlds, Greedfall, Of Orcs &amp; Men) may have glitches and fall short of triple-A standards, but they tend to be fun, have good stories, and mechanics and systems that I enjoy interacting with. Werewolf: The Apocalypse has most of these. I enjoyed taking on an evil corporation, learning more about how the Garou fit into The World of Darkness, and tearing my foes about. I won’t hide from that.

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood is an engaging experience that mixes fun combat mechanics with serviceable stealth/RPG elements for a perfect AA package.

-------------

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood has potential, but is little more than a C-tier experience that's unlikely to stick in anyone's memory for long.

-------------

**[GotGame](https://opencritic.com/outlet/657/gotgame)** - [Brian Zuhl](https://opencritic.com/critic/8052/brian-zuhl) - [6 / 10](https://gotgame.com/2021/02/04/review-werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood/)

&gt;One of the main appeals of Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood is simply playing as a werewolf. It succeeds at this goal, but fails at almost everything else. If you enjoy the idea of rampaging through enemies as a werewolf, then this is the game for you. For those that are seeking a bit more in their games, then this is an easy pass.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Jordan Helm](https://opencritic.com/critic/890/jordan-helm) - [2 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=396678)

&gt;In a game that bills itself as a choice between stealth and combat, it doesn't take long for the deceit to reveal itself and you realize this is ill-suited and insufficiently-handled for either one of the two gameplay styles.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [Daniel Quesada](https://opencritic.com/critic/3764/daniel-quesada) - *Spanish* - [64 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-werewolf-apocalypse-earthblood-accion-licantropos-802605)

&gt;It proposes an universe and some attractive ideas, but they are not interesting enough to overlook a crude graphical performance and some really repetitive gameplay mechanics.

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood is an honest game that might be worth checking out if you're interested in the setting or in its mixture of (light) RPG elements, action and stealth. Just don't expect anything groundbreaking.

**[PC Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer)** - [Luke Kemp](https://opencritic.com/critic/6497/luke-kemp) - [79 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-review/)

&gt;A joyful mix of stealth and action, the fun doesn't snag on the rough edges.

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood is peak mediocrity and lacks any real meat to make it stand out from the rest of the pack.

-------------

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [John-Paul Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/843/john-paul-jones) - [7 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-review-ps5-an-occasionally-thrilling-if-unpolished-guilty-pleasure-that-revels-in-brutality/)

&gt;Absolutely dated in so many ways with crusty stealth gameplay, poor visuals and uninspiring environments, yet showing glimmers of innovation that are in turn bolstered by bouts of super satisfying werewolf combat, Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood  is the first proper guilty pleasure of the year.

-------------

**[Player2.net.au](https://opencritic.com/outlet/520/player2-net-au)** - [Matt Hewson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3904/matt-hewson) - [B](https://www.player2.net.au/2021/02/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-comfort-food-gaming/)

&gt;A big bowl of comfort food gaming, Werewolf is a game that feels like a throwback to simpler times. It is a welcome blast from start to finish and while ultimately forgettable, it is undeniably fun while it lasts.

-------------

**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Henry Stockdale](https://opencritic.com/critic/2300/henry-stockdale) - [5 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/werewolf_the_apocalypse_-_earthblood)

&gt;You can see Cyanide Studios had good ideas for Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood, so it is a shame to see that potential wasted. Tearing through enemies is undeniably satisfying and Earthblood's stealth mechanics feel rewarding but with poor visuals, a short campaign, and disappointing story, you can't ignore these pressing flaws. Cyanide has faithfully integrated Werewolf's lore here – even if that is a little bare – so tabletop series fans will likely enjoy it, but anyone else would best approach with caution.

&gt;Earthblood unfortunately never raises itself above average, ending up as a thoroughly competent beat-’em-up bogged down in less stellar stealth gameplay and rough RPG elements.

-------------

**[Slant Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/318/slant-magazine)** - [Aaron Riccio](https://opencritic.com/critic/1711/aaron-riccio) - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-may-unleash-your-rage-monster/)

&gt;The gameplay throughout isn't freighted with moral urgency, which is disappointing given the game's eco-terrorist themes.

-------------

**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Samuel Guglielmo](https://opencritic.com/critic/1991/samuel-guglielmo) - [3.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/werewolf-apocalypse-earthblood-review)

&gt;Having a hot werewolf can't save Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood from its many problems. A boring story, super reptitive combat, wonky stealth, and atrocious butt rock are just some of the many issues.

-------------

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Nicolò Paschetto](https://opencritic.com/critic/4822/nicol-paschetto) - *Italian* - [5.2 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-recensione/)

&gt;Whether it's lack of effort, time or budget, Cyanide Studio does not enough to provide a satisfying combat system, nor an interesting story-telling, nor a decent technical presentation.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Nick Petrasiti](https://opencritic.com/critic/5526/nick-petrasiti) - [5 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/04/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-review/)

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood feels like it had the potential to be really good, but even though the combat is very satisfying, the drab interludes and disappointing stealth meant I spent a lot of the time asking when the game was going to be over. To me, that speaks volumes.

&gt;Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood is as straightforward as an action-adventure game can be. None of its features are broken, but the shallowness of the entire experience makes it a very hard game to recommend for those who are not into the setting to begin with. It does provide moments of fun here and there, but its linear, derivative experience does not stand out in any way.

&gt;This third-person action game is a little rough around the edges and tries a little too hard to be serious, but its premise and combat is compelling enough to get the job done

I know what you're thinking, how the hell did I not finish Starcraft 2's story until now? Despite my username, I never played Starcraft for its story. I've always been a multiplayer first kinda person. It's the same with Call of Duty. Do you know anybody who plays Call of Duty for Call of Duty's story? Exactly.

Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised. I beat Starcraft 1 many years and I thought the lore/story was good then but I think Starcraft 2 is my new favorite.

To sum it up: 

Starcraft is pretty much a love story between Kerrigan and Reynor. But god damn, it's such a fucking good love story. The overall arc is dominated by the fact that Kerrigan and Reynor cannot be together because of Kerrigan's destiny to be the Queen of Blades aka the Queen of the Zerg and later on, the savior of the universe as she has to fight the Xel'Naga.

Not to mention, the lore is enhanced by the usual amazing Blizzard CGI cinematics. I rewatched all the CGI cutscenes on YouTube and god damn, it was worth it. So much eye candy. Even the Nova side-story is worth playing and checking out.",Which video game franchise has your favorite lore/story?
Games,"I have looked through a ton of ""art-house"" and indie game lists to try to find what I am thinking of. I don't know how old this game is, but it would have been circa 2013-2014 *or earlier* and it has the general style of Braid. Probably much simpler graphics, and you need to connect with another anonymous user online to beat it.

It is very short and primarily a puzzle game like Braid and is probably not very well known. As I recall, someone first leads you through the world, but they are not allowed to talk to you. You each need to do certain things to get through it. One person's actions cannot substitute for the other's. And then you become the leader for someone who is totally naive to the game, and you understand what they are going through, but there is no way you can talk to them. You just need to kind of jump around and try to indicate in these very vague ways what they need to do.

The main purpose of the game was to illicit empathy, and it worked. I think after you beat it you are allowed to finally talk and say ""hi"" to your partner and talk about the frustrations and obstacles.

Can anyone have *any* idea what this might be? I've been trying to figure it out for hours and don't remember it very clearly.",Trying to remember the name of a side-scrolling puzzle game sort of like Braid where you are required to collaborate with an anonymous user and only get to talk/type after you beat the game together.

Games,"The whole point about BOTW is that you can complete the main quest whenever you want - you're the arbiter of the journey, and you choose whatever path you want to Hyrule Castle to fight Ganon. The entire game is about choosing the best route to the main boss, all while enlisting the help of strangers and allies along the way. 

A quest to deliver The One Ring to Mount Doom would function the exact same way, would it not? You start at one end of middle earth, and it's up to you to get to the mountain and drop the ring in the lava however quickly or slowly you want. It'd almost be a retelling of the books, only cast in an alternate light where the player is the ringbearer. 

While I understand such a game would be a massive undertaking, it would finally fulfill that LOTR game the franchise actually deserves - the feeling of a full adventure across Middle Earth, with the ultimate goal being the destruction of the ring.

Games,"Let's start talking about the creation of the Liber game. This adventure story made in Russia tells the story of a young American Alex, he is 24 years old. Born into an ordinary American family, well-mannered, he studied dancing and chess as a child. After a private school he entered the institute, which he graduated with honors, specializing in medieval history. He spends most of his time at work in the museum, as he has a special love for what he does. History took a special place in his life. He most recently graduated from university and got a job at the Utah State Museum.

It would seem that the ordinary life of a young historian in an instant changes beyond recognition. Yesterday's comfort and convenience of the 21st century is being replaced by the harsh conditions of the vikings.

The oldest manuscript is Liber, it contains mysterious knowledge that allows you to travel to different eras of mankind.

The main character could not overcome curiosity and opened this ""Pandora's Box"" But each thing has its own owner, who is this wanderer in time?

Nick ""Ryder"" Rhodes the Viking and the Adventurous Time Traveler

For such characters, there is usually a Best Supporting Actor nomination

Nick is a very charismatic hero of the game. Courageous, gets what he wants, in some moments cruel.

He has a big role to play in the game. Nick, this is the case when you want to see good in a negative

character and sincerely sympathize with him.

In Liber, you have to try on the faces of two completely different heroes of an ordinary American guy and a stern Viking, both of whom found themselves in an unfamiliar environment. What adventures and challenges

lie ahead? Will they be able to find a common language with each other? How will the incident affect them? Will they be able to find their way back? Let's find it out!

And now we want to tell you a little about us:

&gt;Abe's second game is so much more than the remake of a PlayStation title that wasn't even going to be in the main series. The base of the original game and the previous remake is greatly expanded, in the visual, artistic, in the sequences, and in the playable. But expanding is not always improving, more is not always better, although in many moments of the game it is.

&gt;Abe’s weird little world is a bit darker than I was expecting, but it works, after a fashion. The curious juxtaposition of the art design and the narrative makes a strange, yet compelling, impression on the player. The gameplay can trip you up if you’re not used to that stiffer 90s PC platforming style, but you eventually find those muscles. I ran into a few nasty roadblocks, but I never got impossibly stuck. More than the mechanical hurdles, my biggest hurdles were conceptual. Returning to this world, this flavor of frustration and satisfaction, won’t be for everybody. If you’re looking for a portal into an oft-forgotten slice of gaming history, Oddworld: Soulstorm will open that for you. This is an elevated, modernized window into puzzle platformers of the recent past. A little patience and a little perseverance will introduce you to a strange new world.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is undoubtedly the best-looking entry in the series yet, with dazzling cutscenes and beautiful environments. However, when it comes to gameplay, Oddworld: Soulstorm comes with a lot of bugs, and clunky and confusing controls. This made the overall gameplay more sluggish and cumbersome than it ought to be, and, in turn, made tricky levels frustrating and tedious rather than pleasantly challenging. If you’re keen on the Oddworld franchise and are looking to get lost in Abe’s world once again, Oddworld: Soulstorm will have plenty on offer. However, if you’re looking for an immersive platform adventure with straightforward controls, Oddworld: Soulstorm might not be your best bet.

&gt;There are some cobwebs to shake out of Oddworld: Soulstorm, and some that will remain even after a hot shower, but you'd be hard-pressed to name very many games that are doing what this series is doing in 2021. I'm glad that Oddworld Inhabitants is still around, doing their weird and interesting thing.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is an adventure platformer of yest, which manages to modernize its playful formula only at times, with the addition of some guessed tricks aimed at perfecting the frame of Abe's Exoddus. Not everything flows with the right fluidity, and the consistent difficulty of the game is aggravated by unhappy game design choices: yet, when it works, oddworld inhabitants' work manages to guarantee a good deal of contentment, thanks to a substantial content and the immortal fascination a little grotesque by Abe. The same that leads us, more than twenty years after the first episode, to arm ourselves with so much stubbornness to save the Mudokon people, again and again...

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm took Oddworld Inhabitants over two decades to fully realize so it’s disappointing that it came out in the state that it did. Numerous bugs are just one part of the problem as its lack of a quicksave and unwieldy controls cause a lot of easily avoidable irritation. Solving its one-of-a-kind sneaky puzzles can be fairly gratifying at times and its impeccably animated cutscenes are nothing short of amazing, but this is a mixed batch of Soulstorm brew that deserved more time in the production factory.

&gt;Oddworld Soulstorm is a strong follw-up to New'n'Tasty!. It's bigger, very clever, offers some some great new mechanics and its world is still incredibly charming and relevant. But, sadly, it lacks some polish and can be very frustrating because of its bugs or A.I. issues. Only the bravest will succeed in saving all the Mudokons, But in the end, it will be worth it.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is a very good and very compelling game, which veers on the verge of being an all time classic so often, you can't help but be angry at it for not following through. Its stumbles do not take away from all that the game achieves, and just how well it achieves it, and Soulstorm is without a doubt the most rounded out, best playing, and most accessible game in the long running Oddworld series.

&gt;Oddworld Soulstorm introduces a handful of improvements that ultimately make the Oddworld formula better. However, upon finishing Soulstorm, I think I realized that while these additions are nice, there are more fundamental problems with the core mechanics of this series that just feel dated on modern platforms. Double jumping is nice but these controls just feel dated and rigged, I'd rather have smoother and responsive controls over the double jump. Little moments like these kept me from truly being able to enjoy Soulstorm for what it was. And ultimately what should have been a renaissance for the series, was just ok to me.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is hands-down the best entry in the series to date. It takes everything great about these games and packages it up in a beautiful and modern adventure that mirrors its classic gameplay mechanics used for over 20 years. Some of the item management systems weigh on the pacing, and the controls take a few hours to master, but there’s just something unique in every stage that makes this adventure enjoyable from beginning to end.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm offers a refreshing take as a reimagining of an old classic. It provides platforming goodness, a bit of trial-and-error with situations, lots of secrets to find, and thousands of Mudokons to save. Sadly, it does have some noticeable shortcomings related to its controls, friendly AI movement, and save system.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm in many ways is the peak of the Oddworld franchise. Oddworld Inhabitants have taken the hallmarked difficulty and dark humour and revamped it with innovative, new gameplay features and some really cool physics. It's only slightly held back by its overall presentation at launch, but despite this, it largely remains a stellar experience with lots of replayability and challenge for those who are Glukkon for punishment.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is a big, beautiful puzzle platformer with the spirit of Abe's adventures intact and some interesting new ideas, but it's all very quickly undone by imprecise controls, tedious level design and a shocking lack of polish. Oddworld fans will definitely want to check it out, but they may be better off waiting for a few more updates before investing their time, and even then might come away just a tad disappointed.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm presents itself well and shows a grand vision for the series, but as a modern game in 2021, it's just not where it needs to be. It can be extremely awkward to pull off even basic manoeuvres, some new features miss the mark, and certain levels made us want to quit altogether. Bugs exacerbate some of the gameplay frustrations with wonky AI, and ultimately the play experience can be frustratingly rigid. Fans will love this reimagining of a classic, and the franchise's unique charm shines through, but it's a tough sell for anyone coming to the series fresh.

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [Zackerie Fairfax](https://opencritic.com/critic/7130/zackerie-fairfax) - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/oddworld-soulstorm-game-review/)

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm's repetitive gameplay doesn’t make it a bad game, but it does limit the demographic of players that will thoroughly enjoy the game all the way through. Its story and visuals are very impressive and help carry a lot of the game's weight, but playing through hour-long levels with little story elements in between can make Oddworld: Soulstorm a very slow burn. Fans of the Oddworld franchise and 2D platforming games won't be disappointed, but Oddworld: Soulstorm won't keep everyone hooked for very long.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is an excellent adventure game and platformer, with cool mechanics that keep gameplay fresh. The environments are stunning, and the 2.9D animation makes the world feel three-dimensional and lived-in. Only held back by a slew of bugs, Oddworld: Soulstorm is a great installment in a classic franchise.

&gt;Even with some technical issues and a lack of originality, Oddworld: Soulstorm is still one of the ideal games of what Abe's adventures should be. Good.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is an imperfect game, like many other, but unlinke most of them it accepts the idea of taking risks to achieve something different. Unfortunately, it only sometimes happens, but it was worth trying. As Abe knows well, there's no way other than fighting (or jumping, or chanting…) to achieve what you want.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is clearly a labour of love, and I can see that in everything it does. The ambition that bleeds into its story, characters, and gameplay are all evident, but the execution is just sorely lacking everywhere it matters. Perhaps my perspective on past games is warped by nostalgia, but this isn’t the road I imagined Abe and company going down. It’s in the right direction, but they’ve veered off course and landed themselves in a ditch.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm clearly comes from a very passionate, dedicated group of developers. Although it is very rough in places, there are parts of it that really do stick out as excellent examples of both gameplay and storytelling. With more refinement this could have been a shining example of what ground-up remakes could be, but it just falls a little short of the high standards set elsewhere. It's still charming and funny, just like the Mudokens you're trying to save, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is the best 2D stealth puzzle adventure game ever made. From its variety of well-crafted gameplay elements to its sprawling levels that beg to be replayed; it's an incredible journey and with quite a touching story, too.

**[VideoGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/71/videogamer)** - [Josh Wise](https://opencritic.com/critic/7768/josh-wise) - [6 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/oddworld-soulstorm-review)

&gt;In that image lies the appeal-and for some the off-putting twinge-of Oddworld: a bleak and black-hearted concoction, laced with snickering humour and shot through with hope.

&gt;I don’t simply just adore Oddworld: Soulstorm, I also deeply respect its vision. Lorne Lanning and his team took their time to craft an incredibly well-polished game aimed specifically at fans of the franchise. Yet it’s so fun to play and has such an engaging story that even those who have never played an Oddworld game before will still have a great time with its endearing characters, polished controls, and creative puzzles. This game took forever to come out, but it was most certainly worth the wait.

&gt;With an excellent stage and puzzle design, an engaging story that takes some unexpectedly dark turns, and a great presentation, Oddworld: Soulstorm is as good as the first entries in the series if not even better thanks to some new gameplay mechanics. The high challenge level and some other issues here and there may put off some players, but don't let them stop you, even if you just have a passing interest in the series, or the genre as a whole: a game like Oddworld: Soulstorm hasn't been released in a very long time.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm isn't without its issues, but the good far outweighs the bad. Its crafting system will prove controversial, but it is an overall boon to the game. A visual treat through and through that hits its stride after the first few levels.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is Oddworld at its best. It's creative, clever, funny, enjoyable to play

&gt;Abe's second game is so much more than the remake of a PlayStation title that wasn't even going to be in the main series. The base of the original game and the previous remake is greatly expanded, in the visual, artistic, in the sequences, and in the playable. But expanding is not always improving, more is not always better, although in many moments of the game it is.

&gt;Abe’s weird little world is a bit darker than I was expecting, but it works, after a fashion. The curious juxtaposition of the art design and the narrative makes a strange, yet compelling, impression on the player. The gameplay can trip you up if you’re not used to that stiffer 90s PC platforming style, but you eventually find those muscles. I ran into a few nasty roadblocks, but I never got impossibly stuck. More than the mechanical hurdles, my biggest hurdles were conceptual. Returning to this world, this flavor of frustration and satisfaction, won’t be for everybody. If you’re looking for a portal into an oft-forgotten slice of gaming history, Oddworld: Soulstorm will open that for you. This is an elevated, modernized window into puzzle platformers of the recent past. A little patience and a little perseverance will introduce you to a strange new world.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is undoubtedly the best-looking entry in the series yet, with dazzling cutscenes and beautiful environments. However, when it comes to gameplay, Oddworld: Soulstorm comes with a lot of bugs, and clunky and confusing controls. This made the overall gameplay more sluggish and cumbersome than it ought to be, and, in turn, made tricky levels frustrating and tedious rather than pleasantly challenging. If you’re keen on the Oddworld franchise and are looking to get lost in Abe’s world once again, Oddworld: Soulstorm will have plenty on offer. However, if you’re looking for an immersive platform adventure with straightforward controls, Oddworld: Soulstorm might not be your best bet.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is a satisfactory offering that's free for PlayStation Plus subscribers in April. But for those that may be thinking of purchasing the title, you may have some Soul searching to consider.

&gt;There are some cobwebs to shake out of Oddworld: Soulstorm, and some that will remain even after a hot shower, but you'd be hard-pressed to name very many games that are doing what this series is doing in 2021. I'm glad that Oddworld Inhabitants is still around, doing their weird and interesting thing.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is an adventure platformer of yest, which manages to modernize its playful formula only at times, with the addition of some guessed tricks aimed at perfecting the frame of Abe's Exoddus. Not everything flows with the right fluidity, and the consistent difficulty of the game is aggravated by unhappy game design choices: yet, when it works, oddworld inhabitants' work manages to guarantee a good deal of contentment, thanks to a substantial content and the immortal fascination a little grotesque by Abe. The same that leads us, more than twenty years after the first episode, to arm ourselves with so much stubbornness to save the Mudokon people, again and again...

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm took Oddworld Inhabitants over two decades to fully realize so it’s disappointing that it came out in the state that it did. Numerous bugs are just one part of the problem as its lack of a quicksave and unwieldy controls cause a lot of easily avoidable irritation. Solving its one-of-a-kind sneaky puzzles can be fairly gratifying at times and its impeccably animated cutscenes are nothing short of amazing, but this is a mixed batch of Soulstorm brew that deserved more time in the production factory.

&gt;Oddworld Soulstorm is a strong follw-up to New'n'Tasty!. It's bigger, very clever, offers some some great new mechanics and its world is still incredibly charming and relevant. But, sadly, it lacks some polish and can be very frustrating because of its bugs or A.I. issues. Only the bravest will succeed in saving all the Mudokons, But in the end, it will be worth it.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is a very good and very compelling game, which veers on the verge of being an all time classic so often, you can't help but be angry at it for not following through. Its stumbles do not take away from all that the game achieves, and just how well it achieves it, and Soulstorm is without a doubt the most rounded out, best playing, and most accessible game in the long running Oddworld series.

&gt;Oddworld Soulstorm introduces a handful of improvements that ultimately make the Oddworld formula better. However, upon finishing Soulstorm, I think I realized that while these additions are nice, there are more fundamental problems with the core mechanics of this series that just feel dated on modern platforms. Double jumping is nice but these controls just feel dated and rigged, I'd rather have smoother and responsive controls over the double jump. Little moments like these kept me from truly being able to enjoy Soulstorm for what it was. And ultimately what should have been a renaissance for the series, was just ok to me.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is hands-down the best entry in the series to date. It takes everything great about these games and packages it up in a beautiful and modern adventure that mirrors its classic gameplay mechanics used for over 20 years. Some of the item management systems weigh on the pacing, and the controls take a few hours to master, but there’s just something unique in every stage that makes this adventure enjoyable from beginning to end.

&gt;Even with some technical issues and a lack of originality, Oddworld: Soulstorm is still one of the ideal games of what Abe's adventures should be. Good.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is an imperfect game, like many other, but unlinke most of them it accepts the idea of taking risks to achieve something different. Unfortunately, it only sometimes happens, but it was worth trying. As Abe knows well, there's no way other than fighting (or jumping, or chanting…) to achieve what you want.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is clearly a labour of love, and I can see that in everything it does. The ambition that bleeds into its story, characters, and gameplay are all evident, but the execution is just sorely lacking everywhere it matters. Perhaps my perspective on past games is warped by nostalgia, but this isn’t the road I imagined Abe and company going down. It’s in the right direction, but they’ve veered off course and landed themselves in a ditch.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm clearly comes from a very passionate, dedicated group of developers. Although it is very rough in places, there are parts of it that really do stick out as excellent examples of both gameplay and storytelling. With more refinement this could have been a shining example of what ground-up remakes could be, but it just falls a little short of the high standards set elsewhere. It's still charming and funny, just like the Mudokens you're trying to save, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm is the best 2D stealth puzzle adventure game ever made. From its variety of well-crafted gameplay elements to its sprawling levels that beg to be replayed; it's an incredible journey and with quite a touching story, too.

&gt;In that image lies the appeal-and for some the off-putting twinge-of Oddworld: a bleak and black-hearted concoction, laced with snickering humour and shot through with hope.

&gt;I don’t simply just adore Oddworld: Soulstorm, I also deeply respect its vision. Lorne Lanning and his team took their time to craft an incredibly well-polished game aimed specifically at fans of the franchise. Yet it’s so fun to play and has such an engaging story that even those who have never played an Oddworld game before will still have a great time with its endearing characters, polished controls, and creative puzzles. This game took forever to come out, but it was most certainly worth the wait.

&gt;With an excellent stage and puzzle design, an engaging story that takes some unexpectedly dark turns, and a great presentation, Oddworld: Soulstorm is as good as the first entries in the series if not even better thanks to some new gameplay mechanics. The high challenge level and some other issues here and there may put off some players, but don't let them stop you, even if you just have a passing interest in the series, or the genre as a whole: a game like Oddworld: Soulstorm hasn't been released in a very long time.

&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm isn't without its issues, but the good far outweighs the bad. Its crafting system will prove controversial, but it is an overall boon to the game. A visual treat through and through that hits its stride after the first few levels.

Games,"It seems like single player games are getting longer as time goes on. I'm sure it boils down to the fact that people want to feel like they are getting their money's worth. When The Order: 1886 came out for the PS4, the biggest complaint I saw was how short it was. People said it was only an average game as well, but by far the biggest complaint was the length.

The thing is, I miss some of these shorter AAA experiences. I rarely replay games but the ones I have the most are Gears of War 1-3 and Last of Us. A lot of my other favorite games (Witcher 3, Persona 5, Divinity: OS2) are to long for me to justify another playthrough when I have so many other games I want to play. But those 6-12 hour games like Metal Gear Solid 1, Uncharted 1, Resident Evil 3, etc. wouldn't be anywhere near as bad to replay.

I feel like these subscription services could help bring back shorter games. If you're paying $15 a month no matter what, why would you care if the new game your playing is on the shorter side? If it makes it a better experience without a bunch of filler thrown in to pad time \*cough\* platforming \*cough\* then you shouldn't care. Maybe even in the game info page on whatever platform, include the average run time of the game so people aren't thrown off.","Do you think subscription gaming services (Gamepass, stadia, etc.) could rekindle shorter single player games?"

Games,"BioWare is imho was great and unique company that is now a great but less respected label within EA. Part of the loss in respect came from EA and their EA ways going down over the studio because that's just how business works. Publishers have a big say in what they want to see or approve from the studio and their project they're throwing money at, and BioWare got themselves a permanent publisher in EA who directly owns them, and BioWare clearly changed with it over the years.

It's been just about 6 game releases later and something is obviously amiss. People make fun of BioWare and with good reason, unfortunately but there are positive signs of a comeback given the rumors that EA's business plan has adapted and changed after excessive backlash and legal issues over their ""multiplayer only"" strategy and it led to great single player focused games like Jedi: Fallen Order already. A game running on Unreal 4 and actually borrowing a few designs from Mass Effect Andromeda as well as significant team members like Jessica Campbell and one of the big cinematic designeres John Ebenger. A lot of significant leadership staff has returned, perhaps on a contract to create the new upcoming Mass Effect at BioWare. There's a lot to hope for.

It doesn't change that BioWare's recent games, even the good ones before the incompetent releases like Anthem or Andromeda receive common complaints for various reasons. The ending to ME3 sucked, DA2 reused too many assets and was not like DAO at all, Inquisition had nothing but bland fetch quests and a dramatically safe main plot. Then there are also tons of bugs in those games. Really apparent ones, so even as they got relative, or actual praise by critics, fans just couldn't stop picking them apart. Vocal minority or not there did seem to be a special kind of focus on the downsides of BioWare games. Then the bubble really burst when that kind of negativity became mainstream because all the nitpicky flaws became macro-level flaws in their two latest releases. Just all around bugged up mechanics and embarrassing production output. Anthem had a bit more slickness but the thing BioWare is known for, their world-building and roleplaying narratives was a complete afterthought. You didn't even know what the name of the planet you're on is called in Anthem, and the IP can be summarized as ""a world full of unexplained plot devices"". A rough concept, a ""nothing-pitch"". Clearly they were also scrambling to release that game under the pressure of working simultaneously in multiple teams and studios on their other IP. They failed, and Anthem's plans for recovery failed, so now they're only focusing on old IP for the time being.

It all just makes me wonder where the errors are, from a company standpoint or a team standpoint. When did it go wrong, and for how long has it been going in that direction? A lot of it we're not going to see publically undisclosed, such as what might be going on financially or in terms of EA supporting the studio. I do think though, whether it's symptom or cause, there have been signs for years of where they were going wrong team-wise or mentality-wise.

1. They knee jerked to fan reception constantly. Then later when market necessities hit, they alienated fans on multiple occasions. An example would be marketing Mass Effect 3 aggressively as ""This game is PERFECT for new players. You don't need to have a ME1 or ME2 save!"" The feedback from fans was not good with the ending issues, or DA2's disappointments so I can understand their reservations, but the communication in these issues was *not* good between BioWare and the public. They stayed radio silent on things, released PR statements to address the complaints. They flip flopped between being a company that did wish fulfilment constantly and suddenly touting artistic integrity when they decided it was time to not do anything.

2. They over-reacted in post to their feedback. DA2 was too small and narrow? We clearly need to make DA3 the BIGGEST, AND GIVE THE MOST FREEDOM POSSIBLE! Fans hated the ballsy ending to the last game we released? Let's not risk anything and give the most safest and boring ending you can imagine. People loved the Citadel DLC (which was totally not just contextual and needed because of the negativity surrounding the main game) oh let's make our next games kinda like Citadel DLC but 50% of the time! Self referential pandering and in-world memes, conversation scenes inspired by FRIENDS. This is what fans ask for! Let's make Mass Effect *lighthearted*.

3. And that brings us to lack of good direction to guide their projects. This has clearly been the big problem with BioWare. They do make kinda great games, and Anthem aside, they are still unique in creating big blockbuster narrative games where you play as what is essentially an avatar character. Shepard and DA2's protagonists have a bit more definable traits than the rest but you can give them a custom made face, choose their gender and define them through many dialogue options. Through all the weak actual game designing that's been happening since their best games, this has almost remained a constant and why I keep coming back. The problem is that the actual design of the games around this ""player-made"" approach with companion characters, is getting weaker and weaker in my opinion, as a symptom of poor competence or lack of direction to match where games have been going. They weren't exactly fast to get in on the boring Ubisoft trend and when they did it still looked like a lower tier version of it, and worst of all no one really wanted that from their IP. It's the feeling that if it wasn't for outside feedback BioWare has no vision, no aspiration of what they actually want to create. So, being a story-driven studio that's a huge setback, if you don't know what it is that you want to make, and end up taking the table scraps of the games around you to create inferior copies with your previous flavor thrown over it.

I get a lot of it comes from the EA pipeline and market research but I think even with their current ""direction"" of appropriating their beloved IP to the ""AAA-box"" they could've done so much better than what they have and that boils down to one principle imo:

*If you don't react to your errors during development, your audience will when you release it*.

That's what we've been seeing and I keep getting the sense that BioWare is acting surprised about it, or trying to go ""but, but, but"" about things. They blame shifted Andromeda's failures on Horizon and Zelda releasing in close proximity. They didn't wanna just up and confess that Anthem was broken or its loot system was useless. They kept riding their PR strategy about ""bring transparent with fans"" until EA came in and said ""so what the fuck are you doing here?"" Then they attempted a reboot and then that failed because EA can see like most of the audience can see that BioWare is stalling and not having proper vision or prowess to forge ahead. They are wasting their time not getting things done and when they release games in an embarrassing state they appear surprised.

We all probably read those Schreier reports on the studio. What I took from them besides crunch being a bad practice is that the talent attrition has been insane since EA took over and possibly before that. Maybe that's the root cause of all this, but it's been a shame seeing a company as unique as BioWare, especially in this western market where ""RPG"" typically boils down to collecting loot and using a ""crafting system"", fall this hard on their face and practically do it over and over. Thanks are in order to EA for not giving up on their BioWare moniker yet. They deserve to succeed. I just think as an outsider it's been an exercise in frustration to see what they appear to be doing wrong happen in a predictable cycle, perhaps for the third and fourth time now. Perhaps internally at the company the white of people's eyes as they roll them can be seen on a daily basis as their bosses tell them the current plan won't happen until next week for ""reasons"".

That's a lot to write about just one developer. I obviously care, perhaps too much but what can I say, I love Mass Effect to death (buy Legendary Edition please) but all I see is BioWare spinning their wheels in mistakes and failures over problems they seem to not want to admit to each other internally.

Maybe that's too much, perhaps you beg to differ.

TL;DR: we've seen 2 high profile fails and constant stream of negativity coming from fans and consumers for BioWare games. Perhaps it's a sign that BioWare is neglecting the kind of feedback their audience is now giving them, but from each other before shipping their games.",The lessons of BioWare?
Games,"Ok so im not really a programmer at all but I want to see this happen so I guess I'm telling the public in the hopes a real coder picks it up and likes it.

So the working title right now is Wyrm or something like that, but first some backstory.

I love pokemon and digimon and anything that gives you an excuse to have cute animal friends or cool monster pals. I also really liked playing spore alot as a kid and making weird creatures. With pokemon in particular I always enjoyed the idea of breeding but never really liked how they never looked any different or how there was really only one real way to do it well or right, hence all this combining into this little idea.

The Idea

The game starts you off very similar to pokemon by giving you your first warm, name it whatever you like. Wyrms are genderless little fat worms that are basically the simplest living life form possible. They have a mouth and can see and can move around by wriggling. Since its diet is restricted basically to paste and things it can swallow whole and cant move very fast it needs some help to survive. Anywho, you are a new wyrm breeder. The professor explains that as simple as it appears that this is indeed the same species as what you've likely heard of (cool monsters and stuff) but that this is their base form

You see wyrms have very extensive and complicated genetics with genes for all sorts of different traits. But for what ever reason when they're not guided by a breeder out in the wild they always end up devolving back into the base form after enough generations. Even the highly evolved breeds generation after generation get smaller and softer and weaker until they eventually return to being helpless little worms. The professor says that you don't have to do anything beyond just keeping them safe and healthy but that if you feel like it you can try your hand at breeding them towards specific goals.

At this point the game kinda just let's you do your own thing if you wanna do all the things that fine, if you wanna just take care of a little wormy wyrm thats also fine, the game will not punish you for either. But for us all to know here are the options.

Breeding: have 1 or 2 wyrms reproduce either asexually or sexually respectively to make another wyrm!

Exploring: explore the wilds looking for more wyrms, some might have mild mutations!

Competition: have your wyrms participate in certain competitions relating to general fitness and win awards!

Battle: for safety reasons only wyrms with a minimum number of fitness awards can participate in battles, but once they can they can strut their stuff in the ring!

Obviously breeding is the main focus here and is kind of a numbers game so ill get to explaining that a bit now

When breeding there is a long list of possible traits and each trait has a percentage, for instance:

Trait: hind legs

Percentage: 1% (tiny nubs)

Percentage: 100% (large highly developed legs)

Some traits may have prerequisites in the form of other traits being above a certain percentage that might prevent you from acquiring the trait or from getting a higher percentage for that trait (you can't have feet without legs, but legs don't do well without feet). 

When breeding asexually the children have a random chance to have a random mutation and the parents preexisting mutations with be passed down with small range of increased or decreased prominence (let's say a difference of 5%) and the more traits it already has the less likely it is to develop new unrelated traits.

When breeding with a partner the traits the child has are based on an average between the parents (20% and 40% = 30%) and will use the random range from that point (if average is 30% range is 25%-35%) with a much smaller chance of developing new traits, but a much higher chance of developing related traits (get some feet for those legs!) 

As far as prerequisite traits go the higher your percentage for the prerequisite the higher your chance of getting the trait its a prerequisite for. This is of course because of traits like legs eventually hitting a critical point where they need some sort of feet to function at a higher degree of development but the two are separate as there are many types of feet to choose from.

Certain traits will of course be incompatible to a certain degree. For instance you can't have hooves and paws on the hind legs at the same time. Any two wyrms can mate no matter how distant in mutations but if they have incompatible mutations then one of the two will be chosen at random, to explain: 

Wyrm A has 100% hooves on hind legs

Wyrm B has 100% laws on hind legs

Pick Hooves or Paws at random

Picks hooves

Average for hooves between wyrm A and wyrm B is 50%

Range is 45%-50%

However some traits are semicompatible. You can't have 100% fur and 100% scales but you could have a combination of the two that adds up to 100%, such as 50/50 or 75/25.

Beyond these rules im not sure how much farther to go with this.

Games,"I'll go with a fictional city and Cartel to avoid disrespecting any real life organizations and victims of the drug war. It'll be linear and focusing on the horrors of living in that underworld. You play as a member of a fictional cartel and start at the very bottom as a Sicario and trafficker. You transport narcotics and perform hits across the city and use the money you make to further the story, upgrade vehicles, weapons, ect. I want death to be a constant reminder to the player. The smallest thing, like playing the music in your speakers too loud, to being in the wrong turf to be something to keep the player on their seat.
  
This game would be open world but on a smaller scale due to wanting to make the city as detailed and interactive as possible. The game is more focused on story with the difficulty being fixed in order to weave them both together.

Games,"Hello friends,   


I somehow only play rocket league for almost 3 years now which I really like a lot since I am getting better etc but after this game I lost somehow the idea of playing video games before. Somehow when watching trailers I really dont get that excited anymore. I will list the last games I completed or played longer maybe I have missed some because it looks to me that you almost dont get a new experience anymore somehow its all the same... When I now remember how it was to complete for example resident evil 4, dead space 1 everything was totally new and cool. Now to the lets say ""last"" somehow exciting games I liked alien isolation a lot, dying light (was nothing new but in a way a perfect mix of each genre element), bloodborne (with the important change to be rewarded for a more aggressive playstyle),  resident evil 7 (had a few very nice moments! but the end at the ship was kind of lame), hellblade senuas sacrifice (just completed it was kind of meh), evil within 2 (same as hellblade, fest a little like resi4).... What I see and know is that I missed witcher3 and horizon zero dawn because somehow I know I will need to spend a lot of time to complete them (which should be epic games)... thats for example why I quit MGS5. After a few missions I felt like how much time I would need to put into it etc :D  ","Somehow games dont catch me anymore as the used to be, do you have titles which I might have missed?"

Games,"Hey! I’m a gamer with 10 years experience. Also I’m a crypto trader. I know this is a crazy fusion. My hobbies led me to this idea: what if we could integrate cryptocurrency to usual games. 

Probably you’ve heard something about it. And just imagine: you play WoW and you buy all the items with crypto. The first advantage is that all items you bought belong to you. Not WoW or the other games developer. Second advantage -  you have them on your wallet and you can buy them and sell them with cryptocurrency. What is more, you don’t depend on banks operations and do not have to pay fees to third parties. Another advantage is that your data is safe and protected. You are independent. 

Sounds like a fairy tale. The true is that it is all possible with cryptocurrency. And I wish one day game developers will integrate crypto currency. That would be great. 

Would you like crypto in your fav games? And, apart from the obvious advantages, can you think of how crypto could be bad for games?

Games,"My friend came to visit from out of town, and while he was staying with me he said he felt like playing a ""choose your own adventure game,"" as he put it, similar to Heavy Rain.  So we picked up Detroit and started playing, without knowing anything about it save that it was about robots and apparently took place in Detroit.

For the first few chapters we switched off the controller each chapter.  We made decisions cooperatively, and whoever was holding the controller had the final say.  This is how we usually play games.  However, shortly after we started, my roommate came home.  Since there were three of us and three playable characters, we decided to switch to having dedicated characters for each of us.  By sheer coincidence, the order in which we played the next three chapters matched up perfectly with our personalities:

My roommate is very family oriented and protective.  He played as Kara.

My friend who I started the game with has always been a wild card, and a doer rather than a thinker.  He played as Markus.

I am very logical and a problem solver.  I played as Connor.

At that moment, the game just *clicked*.  We switched from following a general story to becoming lost in role playing our characters.  Every decision from that point was individual and made through the eyes of our respective characters.

&gt;!Chapters with interactions between two characters were particularly incredible, such as Connor and Kara both having required quick time events during a chase scene.  I was truly trying to take her down, and she was truly trying to escape, yet there was a mutual respect when we passed the controller back and forth.!&lt;

I truly believe this is the best way to play the game and urge anyone with exactly two friends to do the same.  10/10 unforgettable experience.

I maintain that he is reading too much into it and the android industry probably followed the automobile industry.

Games,"Most people don't want to hear any more thoughts about this - it's been discussed to death by this point.

*What exactly happened in INSIDE?* I have asked myself this very question a myriad of times.

&amp;#x200B;

However, to put the endless thinking I have about this game to rest, I have decided to write an ultimate, final conclusion. This is dedicated to all of you who's been thinking as much about it as I have. I expect most people that are willing to read this that they are familiar with a few or more well known theories out there. However, I will make it somewhat friendly to those of you who aren't.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, **I believe INSIDE did have a literal story, and the secret ending was a touch of massive ambiguity to break the fourth wall**. After all this time I've spent picking this game apart and thinking about what all the details mean, I feel very confident in my conclusion - or theory, if you may.

&amp;#x200B;

I will begin by explaining what I believe is literally happening in the main game. Remember, not everyone knows about the secret ending. To have a clear mind and structure about what the hell is going on, I have come to realize that this alternative ending is just something that should be thought about as an extra potential layer to the events taking place. I will get to that if you read far enough.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're with me and ready to delve into the world of INSIDE one last time, you could always immerse yourself with the amazing [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsK-7q3j-I) while doing so.

\------------------------------------------------------

Right off the bat, It is clear to me that some *looping experiment* is going on in INSIDE. This is coming from someone who's been thinking about this gem ever since it came out, perhaps reading way too much about opinions and secrets over the years. What I'm getting at is that I am aware it must sound crazy to propose this idea. However, there is too much evidence supporting it. I will break several subtle moments down as well, which I believe are very important albeit easily overlooked by many.

&amp;#x200B;

**You're always inside the compound**. From the very start, you were inside. I've found that people usually just think that you were inside all along at the ending, but no. There are even artificial roads and trees at the start of the game. Don't think that's the case? There's a giant machinery/factory for constructing entire roads ""inside"" the facility later on. The diorama you see that most of you out there know about, shows the ending area, which is essentially a large stage meant for the Huddle (The Blob) to believe it's free. That stage needs ""scenery"". For example, trees. Oh yeah, if it happens that you forgot, you are *deep* underground by the end too - do you think that light in the distance was the sun?

&amp;#x200B;

**They are always tracking you**. These people are thought to be hunting you - the only official description of the game states the same, but that's what Playdead *wants* you to think. It's meant to be misleading. Hell, the ending itself was. Again, it's a looping experiment, and they always know where you are located ... somehow. Don't think this is the case either? Then bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Near the start of the game, the truck that's ""searching"" for you is driving along a road just before you have to jump down and hide under a rock. There's a dense pack of trees and greenery between the boy and this truck before that happens. If the truck really is searching for the boy, there is no way they would see him walking this little pathway. No human can see through that forest thicket while driving on a road on the other side of it, let alone during the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets interesting. Knowing all that, if you have top-notch headphones like me or simply just pay attention to the sounds, this car follows your precise movement while walking down the path. When you move two meters, they drive two meters. When you stop, they stop. They *know* you're there, even if they can't directly see you. Playdead's careful attention to meticulous detail and polish suggests that this is not some forgotten coding about the sequence, it's purposefully put there for us that like to analyze deeper and find out what the hell is going on. So, this means they've seen you walk down that specific road ... many times.

&amp;#x200B;

You're probably wondering why I'm just randomly jumping to the conclusion that this is all a looping experiment. Even though what I've stated above are good reasons, it's not enough. But there is more.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, this boy - or rather *these* boys (I'll get to that) - are running along this route towards the Huddle's chamber. We know the Huddle is controlling him/them. Throughout the game, there are all of these puzzles, chases and whatever - these are *meant* to be stumbled upon. They are tests. Okay, what for? **They are sequences designed to test the Huddle's intelligence**. What will it decide to do here? Will it find a different way to go about it the next time? What is it actually capable of in terms of outsmarting them?

&amp;#x200B;

They realized this mind-control hive mind of theirs was not as primitive as they'd originally thought, and so they started researching its intellectual capabilities. Naturally, it became their most treasured and monumental experiment.

&amp;#x200B;

These people/scientists observed that it will fail the tests, many times - in which case they'll have to start another run. You'll sooner or later discover that they not only create artificial objects for the environment and so on, but **people** as well. Whether these ""drones"" as many call them are truly artificial, cloned, mutated or a hybrid of any of these is not necessarily known, but that's not really the point. We know they can survive impossible falls that should've rendered them completely useless and would have possibly broken every bone in their body - but right after they're walking just fine. Body parts are able to move on their own once dismembered. Obviously this is not normal, neither is anything within this corrupt society (or if it is a society at all). I believe they are mass produced, perhaps mind-controllable from the beginning of their creation, given they are ""bred"" with the worms this technology originated from. Anyway, to summarize this, they are severely tampering with human bodies, real or not - which leads me to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

Same goes for our little boy. Now, he does seem more reactive and emotionally aware than the others, but that should not automatically suggest they can't do the same things to him. He is expendable. At the earlier stages, they shoot him with sleeping darts, not bullets. They take him out by stopping his breathing, which isn't always fatal. All this means he failed the current test. The sentries that shine lights around? They'll pull him in if he's spotted. Why? If the Huddle can't hide from them, they'll drag him in because he failed - it's just another aspect of its intelligence they're testing out. I wouldn't know if the more severe ""deaths"" are actually authentic because of the blood, but given what this society has achieved in terms of technology, they can easily bring back another copy if the boy were to fail. Depending on the failed situation, they either decide to put him back where he started, as he was just unconscious and most probably altered by some mysterious means ... or create another replica.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I continue, you must be asking, why this boy specifically? Or rather, since there are more, why that exact ""model""? He isn't the only one under control of the Huddle, though this whole experiment on loop revolves around his actions, so my best guess would be that it is just very easy to differentiate him from everything and everyone else. They can instantly spot him, as he is the only one with such an appearance. It's a bit of a stretch, but I really do think this is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one specific scene shortly before the boy enters the Huddle, a key moment that I'm certain so many overlook. You enter a room where you'll need to change the water level, which is affected by anti-gravity. However, something happens in this very room but not anywhere else in the entire game. The camera zooms out, making the scene something that is very much like you're looking through an observing glass since you actually *see* one as it zooms out, studying this boy. The sounds within this room are inaudible, as well, which is seriously strange considering that hasn't happened up until that point, nor after. What else is there to enforce the fact that this is a prime example of just another test? Well, on the opposite side of this room, is another looking glass. Guess what? You see one (or two, I cannot remember but it's not important) individuals, just standing there. There is a video camera on a stand beside them, seemingly filming the whole thing. **Why do you think that is**?

&amp;#x200B;

What now remains is the shock wave sequence and the ""water lady"". People are really confused how these tie into everything else. I'll start with this massive cavern or atrium with the shock waves, whatever the hell it takes place in.

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't think it's anything substantially different or more important than any of the other tests*. It's noticeably more difficult and complex, but that's it. It's a grand challenge for the Huddle's intelligence, requiring a skilled sense of timing and preparation ahead of time in order to succeed. It's pushing the boundaries of what it is able to do. (*The end of this segment is where you see the factory of mass-produced roads, although it seems to be inactive at the time being*.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the water lady and the boy slowly sinking down with a cable giving water breathing properties? What in gods name is this event about, really? I am fully aware that this is where my conclusion will unavoidably meet some expected problems and tons of questions, but it is what it is - A breaking point of **all** theories out there. I'll just keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand, this water being (and the others, as I believe there are more) is a failed experiment gone seriously hostile (or so it seems) as a result of the tampering with drones over time, combined with the scientist's completed research on breathing underwater. It was never trying to oppose the goal of the Huddle, because most probably, the Huddle was controlling this water lady as well. It was trying to hook the boy up to a cable. I think all the instances where he gets drowned is simply another failed test, because it didn't locate a needed cable, or whatever else it failed to do. The Huddle is much likely completely ignorant towards the boy not having the ability to breathe underwater, which is probably one of many reasons it failed the tests. Why was the boy avoiding it, then? That is a hard one for sure. Perhaps it couldn't multitask well? Heh, thanks Playdead, I thought I had it. However, it eventually succeeded.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these tests, trials, mind games and such that the Huddle has overcome ... they've thrown so many challenges at it, yet it finally persisted after all the loops. You're at the end goal, and of course they'll be overly excited about it. They want to witness the grand moment. They don't care about catching you, because you've passed the whole experiment ... for now. The only thing left is what will happen when the Huddle absorbs\*(?)\* you.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever's going on when you get sucked into it and what makes it break free, these people knew such a thing would happen. With all their research, they've created a meticulous route for the Huddle, in it's raw form - a new series of experiments. *This is a combination of tests judging its mental* ***and*** *physical properties, combined*. They already know it's smart enough to do all it did to ""free"" itself, so they don't need to examine that particular aspect any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

It breaks free, or so it thinks. They now know what it's able to do and what tasks it will be able to perform. **Perhaps they could create another**? As I will explain some things about the secret ending, they're probably running the *entire* experiment, from start to finish, many times. The Huddle ends up near the fake sea and sun, they suspend it in the tank, rinse and repeat. They're gathering information and data.

&amp;#x200B;

A final thing I'd like to say before I end the story explanation is light against the worms. The water lady reacts negatively to it, and she's most probably infused with them in some way. The Huddle must also be that way, since it rests in the light at the end. People say it died at that point, but I believe it really was paralyzed, intentionally so. Again, explained further for the secret ending.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I think happened in INSIDE. At some point, you just have to put the hammer down and conclude it. As short and simple as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

That marks the end of the main story conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Before I end this, I will quickly talk about the secret ending. I stated that I believe it's another ""layer"" to the story, but by this I mean another **mind control layer**. They want to break the fourth wall by making you, the player, ask yourself: ""What is controlling me?"" or rather ""Am I in control?""

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned, this ending is also connected really well into the main story for literal purposes as well if you think about it. The Huddle realizes it's repeatedly being experimented on, wants to break the loop, only way to do that is to disconnect itself. Why would it go down there and not be noticed? It happens very quickly, perhaps they simply can't get the boy in time. It could very well be the case, and it could be a carefully crafted plan by this rogue member of the facility that decided to go against everything they were doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, this is just a vague statement of a side-thing by Playdead about control and free will, actually very much tied to the main story as well. If you were controlling the Huddle, that was controlling the boy which just now slumped down and ""disconnected"", is someone controlling you, even just metaphorically? Is our society, culture and general media imposing its views, opinions on lifestyles, everything we know about who we are ... on you? So on and so on. They want you to wonder if you are truly free in doing or thinking whatever you want.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

INSIDE is good at making you question everything twice, because there's always something else to be found that challenges everything you thought was the case about the story. I think it's genius, especially for the very specific audience it has seemed to touch on. However, it feels so good to have a concrete answer to the immense confusion I've suffered from it. It's not a bad thing, I loved all the thinking I had to do. I can't believe it, but that pondering about the story and world was essentially 50% of the game for me. It may not be a satisfactory answer for others, but for me, it really is.

I was just discussing this the other day. The lack of gameplay features like storing things on wagons or buying properties that are completely devoid in the game, sure they bother me. But they arent the big issue either. The issue is the game lacks any kind of vision. I actually started feeling buyers remorse a couple hours after the game allowed me to free roam. Not because it was great up until then, but because I was waiting for free roam to have any real control. Then, when I was given control, I found the game so shallow I’ve hardly been back to it. Two days after I bought it I wished I had bought a physical copy - I could at least get some of my money back.

Here’s what bores me.

I could play for ten hours or a hundred hours and my character Arthur would basically be the same, sans the honor scale. Simply put, there’s no long term progression, and everything about the game has been designed around novelity encounters. There are no skill trees. There’s no buying and developing land. There’s no creation or management of a “possey”. I can’t foster relationships over time and become deputy. I can’t then become sheriff. I can’t develop lasso skills. I can’t develop farming, or learn to cultivate anything. I can’t marry anyone and have to protect them as a consequence. I can’t recruit someone I’ve helped. I can’t recruit many people over time to join a “possey” of which I’m the leader and decide what KIND of things we do. I can’t decide who’s riding with me that day, and thus affect gang member dynamics like pecking order (who is Second?), jealousy, and cooperation...or mutiny.

The game has zero vision, and worships meaningless novelty. It’s so damned boring because everything you do is a variation on the exact same thing with no real consequences other than a wanted level that’s been their hallmark since forever.

If there was a recruitment system, it could be dangerous to have two hot tempered men in a ten man possey. Maybe they kill each other. Maybe they start fights and get wanted levels in towns I wanted to have a good reputation with. So I’d have to deal with them...eject them from the gang and risk their ill favor. Or kill them. Or do nothing and have lynch mobs and the police hunting my gang down.

There’s no option to recruit men and be a positive force...just “good company” who will ride with you to take down bounties. There’s no option to clean up the west with my commitment to law and order and recruiting good men.

There’s no option to become a casino or bar owner who runs a shady business. There’s no option to take out the shady business owner and replace him with a reputable practice.

After forty hours, maybe I have a max of twelve men in my gang. Maybe I have a wife. Maybe I have a homestead that I’ve developed. Maybe I’ve accumulated land. Maybe I’m better with a lasso than a pistol. Maybe I’m better at resolving things with dialogue than with force.

Know what I can do in this game? I can go start a gun fight. Then I can loot the corpse. Then...I can do it all over again. And I can post videos of horse wrecks and throwing dynamite at the KKK. The game seems specifically designed to impress people who have short attention spans and are really, really, really impressed by graphics.

The game seems like the world’s greatest RPG had its funding cut immediately after the most meager walking, running, and shooting mechanics were installed, but before any meaningful progression was added. ANY.

Don’t get me wrong. I like a few brainless games. But if the only thing I can do is shoot people and ride horses, the mechanics need to be better than the horror show they are. Cumbersome movement isn’t “realistic,” it’s just annoying.

The beginning and end of its problems are that there are no long term goals that can be chosen by the player. Your options, the moment you login, are all short term. The only “long term” feature is bounty level...which can be paid off or which - surprise - leads to more pistol shooting. Merely an escalaton of random encounters that end in you shooting someone and looting them. How about some permanent consequences?

Rockstar has zero vision. It’s not going to age well. This is the most boring game I have played in the last year. Then there’s the cognitive dissonance expressed online: “it’s a game that you take your time with, and if you’re in a hurry, you won’t enjoy it.” I’m not in a hurry, captain virtue signal. I just want to choose meaningful, long term goals, not clumsily mosey to the next gun fight.

Red Dead 2 is basically a buffet of mostly similar encounters. On two occasions, I’ve logged on and just sat there looking at my character before turning it off and playing something else. I literally couldn’t muster the desire to go do some random thing.

Graphics are stunning, world is rich on content and the general atmosphere really sucked me in. Attention to details is almost unparalleled. The story is predictable and feels a bit forced - some turn of events simply doesn't make sense and the characters turn either dumb or genius according to what's convenient in furthering the storyline - and it's also quite quite static. 

All in all it's not very ""organic"" nor does it allow for the player to interact with it in any profound ways. 

But despite not being the pinnacle of penmanship nor deeply influenced by the player's decisions - it did entertain me and in addition to falling in love with the world itself I also ended up becoming invested in the characters and even sad to see some of them go. 

Rockstar is - as always - brilliant in creating the framework of a truly inspired game. Rockstar is also however - as always and unfortunately - mediocre at best when it comes to everything else. 

Gameplay suffers profoundly in this game. The controls are clumsy and bad - needlessly hard to navigate, often unresponsive - and both movement as well as combat are clunky to say the least and altso unimaginative. Something youd expect from a game made ten years ago - not a more recent AAA-Production. 

It lacks anything even resembling flow and also falls short in terms of user friendliness. Gunplay is pretty much autoaim and instant headshot - melee is simply mashing two buttons in accordance to animation and the mechanics for fishing actually made my hands go numb. 

And even though the story is good enough (though not as brilliant as many would argue) - the missions are unrewarding tours. In fact - the way they're played out - you hardly get to influence them at all as the game itself pushes you down certain paths and makes most decisions for you. 

They're so overly-scripted your actions and options constantly gets limited to a point where you might as well put the controller on the table and simply watch a movie. Most of the time you just follow character X through points A-Z then either click the objects he tells you to click or kill whomever he needs you to kill before being rewarded with a cutscene. It feels more like a tutorial that never ends than an actual game - and often it even dictates where you're allowed to move and at which pace or whether or not you're allowed to have your guns ready. 

Even your weapon setup is affected. Went through a lot of trouble choosing and prepping the desired weapons pre-mission? Tough luck as this game will revert your choices to what it wants you to use during the first cutscene (even though the weapons it forces upon you are of the same type as the ones you'd prefer). 

This to me was maybe my biggest nuisance - as I felt this game was treating me like an idiot. Some unwanted parasite in need of restraints. ""Shut up and let me get on with my awesome story won't you? No ofc I won't let you influence it - I tell it best as it is - I am in charge this experience not you!!"" 

As for fishing and hunting and doing bounties plus experiencing random world events - as well as crafting - they've actually done a good job. But like it always is with these things they do get repetitive after a while and starts to feel grindy. It doesn't help either that the world is so littered with animals you can almost aim the rifle randomly and still hit something nor that you'll catch a fish pretty much every time you throw your line in. It would have been better if wilderness encounters reaped higher rewards but were less frequent I feel - but it's nothing gamebreaking. 

All in all Red Dead Redemption 2 has all the ingredients to be the epic experience most reviewers make it out to be - but doesn't really come close in terms of execution. Gameplay is outdated and user-unfriendly - it lacks both polish and innovation - balance is a bit off here and there and the game fails miserably all across the line in terms of player interaction. The story and the missions are pretty much set in stone - and it refuses you to equip the chisel. 

Most of the time you're not really playing a game - merely watching events unfold the way the developers intended them to - practically sidelined and incapable of influencing anything at all.

Games,"I don't know if r/Games is the best place to have my question answered or not. I'm also only asking this question out of curiosity.

So I heard of Yokai Watch back in like mid-2015 through the JWittz and his robopon video. Thought nothing of it to be frank. Then the few months later it came out in the west and it being inescapable for a few months. Again I thought nothing of it  for the simple fact that I simply not really interested in it ((and to be quite Frank I'm still not interested)). 

3 years later, it has all but disappeared well in the west at least. Most people I talk to about Yokai Watch say ""What even is that?"", and or are completely apathetic towards it.

Is this a regional thing, or a matter of how big the local market is? Have you ever seen a commercial for an arcade where they feature this specific new game?",Question about the tie-in videos for Wreck-It Ralph
Games,"I just want to get a few things out of the way. 

First of all:
I’m sick and tired of people complaining about the economy of the game, who the hell cares that beans cost $6 but you can sell a gold ring for $1.15 they priced everything based off of how much money people are able to obtain online. Believe it or not, money is not hard to come by.

My complaint about people complaining about money:
As mentioned before, money is not hard to come by! People act like this game doesn’t even give you a chance, and forces you to buy the micro transactions. I was hunting for a total of 30 minutes and made around $40-$50 by finding perfect pelts and returning carcasses to the butcher. If you want money in this game, work for it. It doesn’t fall into your lap.

About refilling your cores:
This kind of goes along with my second point. When you hunt, you find food and ingredients to make better meals to fill your cores up more. I NEVER buy anything from the shop for my player or horse, I scavenge for it all. Carrots, tobacco, apples, venison all will fill your stamina cores and it won’t cost you a dime to find them out in the wild.

Greifing Players:
Yes. Kids are going to be little assholes a lot of the time and gang up on you. You want to know how to combat that? Queue up for posses and ask people if they are willing to hunt, or do stranger missions. In this game, much like back in the day, you have strength in numbers.. A good amount of the time, if people see me riding back to town with carcasses on my horse, they won’t mess with me (your experience may vary, if you do get killed on your way to sell stuff, either go to a different city, or take my other suggestion and see if anyone wants to hunt as a posse.)

Sorry if I’m all over the place, I’m at work and I shouldn’t even be typing this. I just wanted to maybe shed some light for those people who only played an hour and determined the game is broken.

Games,"Thief: The Dark Project, often considered the granddaddy of stealth-em-ups, launched 30th November 1998.

It's fair to say this game (along with its sequel) changed the face of gaming forever. If you've played Dishonored, that game owes a lot to its forebear, as do games like Skyrim or horror masterpiece Amnesia, and yet Thief still retains an entirely unique charm of its own. Brilliant atmosphere, sound design and a finely-paced series of levels make it really enjoyable even today. I only discovered the game five years ago, and it's stuck with me ever since. If you have any thoughts and memories of this game, by all means share them below!

Fortunately the community is still very much alive, in large part because Looking Glass studios released a level editor in 1999. Since then there have been over a thousand Fan Missions created for the series, along with [The Dark Mod](http://www.thedarkmod.com/main/) (a standalone spinoff). If you've played custom level packs for Quake, Doom, Half-Life or Build engine games you know roughly what to expect, although these are usually more story-driven and of course slow-paced experiences.

A few hours ago a set of 24 levels and mini-campaigns came out as part of the 20th Anniversary Contest. You can check them out [here](http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=149369). We have missions from veteran authors and community members, alongside plenty of new faces. This time there's one big restriction on the mission authors: NO custom assets or things that couldn't have been done by Looking Glass back in 1998, these missions need to be true to the spirit &amp; style of the original game.

If you'd like to give them a try, you'll need to follow [these instructions](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project#Fan_Missions) to patch and get Fan Missions working with your copy of the game. I encourage you to enjoy, and vote on your favourites before the March 1st deadline.

Games,"So I remember the good old days when free to play was about as popular as herpes. Even aside from some of the questionable pay to win business practices, it was also synonymous with delivering bad quality. For a quality game, you still had to be with the € 60 games of the big game studios. 

Fast forward to today and all the big titles are free to play. Not only are they often making more money, but they are also more often becoming better quality games. 

LoL is obviously still the number 1 online game. Warframe is hugely popular and whipes the floor with destiny 2 and the more recent Fallout76. Path of Exile is continuesly churning out content by the bucketload while Diablo 3 owners haven't had any new stuff in ages. Finally while Call of Duty and Battlefield are struggling, PUBG is completely dominating the first person shooter world. 

So is the future free to play? ""No way!"", would I have said just a few years ago. But now I'm not so sure. If you look at how the model works for Path of Exile for example, you see that the game developers have something to gain by providing continues content to the gamer. They win if people actually play, whereas Blizzard only wins if people buy their game or an expansion in the shop. And it shows by them working so hard to contiuesly improving their product. 

Now some developers are trying to have it two ways, ask a starting price for their game and then add a shop as well. But they don't seem to achieve the same mass market penetration that a game that is truly free like for example PuBG or LoL can achieve. 

So what's your thoughts? Is this trend going to continue? Do you foresee a future where pay to play will dissapear and will the current big game studios have to shift their strategies to stand any chance against the indy gamestudios?",Free to play is dominating the world right now

Games,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

I love space games and I've played quite a few (Elite Dangerous, Rebel Galaxy, Battlefleet Gothic Armada, Starpoint Gemini 1, II and Warlords etc).

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing that pisses me off though, is how the brutal majority of space games always end up being about dogfighting in space rather than control your capital ship and play it on a more strategical or tactical level (hell, broadsides are fun!). The problem with dogfighting is that you're always just trying to align your cursor to a red dot in the distance, get close enough, shoot, loop around, rinse and repeat... I have 300 hours in Elite Dangerous and I can say without a doubt that the level of satisfaction  I get when piloting a ship (the sound quality and attention to certain details is just so great in that game) is immense, but by God, does the dogfighting tire me... I absolutely love the graphics, the game quality etc and I can say that the combat is not terrible, but I would really like to find games like Rebel Galaxy, where you're playing a huge ship with tons of guns and you're controlling/viewing from a third person perspective, if you will, where you can see the actual ship you're fighting against and you're not just trying to loop around every few seconds, as if you were just jousting in space.

(Again, I have 300 hours in Elite, so I know about controlling your ship and, if you're agile enough, you can just stick to the rear or the top of your enemy by drifting and controlling your side movements, but that's still a FPS view, if you will, which is what annoys me)

&amp;#x200B;

I tried Star Trek Online and I'll be brutally honest, if it weren't for the absurdly horrible land combat which you're forced to take, the fact that it's all about lasers (give us some good ol' projectile weapons as well!!) and the fact that it's just full of pay to win elements, that would satisfy me very much and I would not hesitate to play something like that, for example.

I absolutely LOVED Rebel Galaxy (the first one, not the new one where they're simply making it yet another dogfighting game...) but it was limited and I sunk about 40 hours into it until i achieved the maximum I could.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love a game that allows me to conquer (and improve on) bigger/better ships, armor, skills and weapons.

This new line of posts was inspired by [this video](https://www.captiongenerator.com/1225772/Atlas-devs-talk-release-day) and particularly the part at which it is stated that after two hours you can't refund. 

**Not true!**

If you are an EU citizen you can refund, regardless anything else as long as

&gt; [the] goods you bought turn out to be faulty or do not look or work as advertised.

[source](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm)

So, when the Atlas's devs specifically said that they will make a game with concurrent 40k players and they can host only 150 people, then the game you bought is not working as advertised and as an EU citizen you are entitled to a refund.

It may not be an easy battle, but you should be able to save your money.

The same goes for Ashes of Creation.

First of all, if you are an EU citizen you bought a game that was supposed to be self-published and now it is being published at your area by My.com. This by itself is enough for you to claim that the product will not be as advertised and you can have your refund. Furthermore, the game was supposed to be pay2play with no pay2win and My.com (the publisher of your region) is notorious for publishing p2w games. Lastly, now the company (Intrepid studios) is making a f2p game (Ashes of Creation Apocalypse), whereas they were clear that they don't like f2p games. This game is funded by the money you (the backers) gave, in order for an MMORPG to be made, and did not give in order for a BR game to be made. 

Don't just whine at the internet, fight for your rights, especially when they are legally guaranteed. 

As always, best of luck to everyone and if you are so kind, please spread the word to those who are in the same predicament as you.

I'd encourage people to save information (such as videos) at which Sharif explicitly says/mentions that they will self-publish and that there will be no p2w and no f2p.

But I brought my PS4 home and that what the hell it’ll be a good game to chill to and listen to music during. But no this game is awful. I was truly blown away EA published this game because the FIFA series is miles ahead of this game. FIFA has its faults but it’s at least bettered itself in a lot of graphical ways and physics and whatnot. Nothing has changed from NHL 16 (last one I had). In fact, from what I can tell, it removed shit. That’s it. It’s a limited version of NHL 16. I didn’t see any sort of career mode at all. I also noticed how bland the whole thing was. No soundtrack, terrible menus, and a direct focus on HUT. So boring and simple and expected. God this game sucks. Seems like everything is a penalty and poke checks send players careening to the box every two minutes. My buddy had 30 penalty minutes. Half that game he was down one player and most of the penalty’s were the result of the game just throwing a hissy fit and allowing stupid physics shit to happen. Everything feels so stiff and slow and wobbly. Regularly I saw players just completely glitch out and freeze between animations for a second, especially goalies. And it’s $60 on release.

I miss NHL 2K7. Yeah, different series and different time but god damn it was amazing on PS3. Everything felt so well paced and momentum felt really real and natural on the ice. I remember being able to check players with the movement pherephrial inside the dual shock three and the concept now seems like it’d be innovative because it was a really fluid mechanic. Felt ‘real’ as well.

Games,"It seems that, for one reason or another, female players aren't making much headway into the world of professional and competitive gaming. Whether it's not wanting to associate with difficult men in the community or something else, I think a division might be helpful. It could give them a chance to show that they really are good at the games but that the existing infrastructure just isn't making that apparent.

I don't consider this an issue of calling women worse at video games, as most, if not all, professional games and sports have men and women's leagues. Thoughts?","Should there be separate divisions for men and women's competitive games, similar to what exists for games like chess?"
Games,"I think we are due to the confluence of several factors:

* Ongoing infiltration of radical leftist ideologues - from devs to producers - which makes games explicitly hostile to their traditional audience - white males. For example, the isometric BattleTech mech game from Harebrained Schemes did **not include a single white character**, which is opposite to the entire Battletech universe. Andromeda from Bioware looked like a post-white-genocide game. Dice is the same way with their blackwashing of European history. The mask is certainly falling off. 
* Predatory monetization policies that create bad faith.
* You can't create games with interesting storylines due to this rampant and toxic leftist culture of correct speech and correct thoughts, uniformly accepted and enforced within the corporate world.

As such, these factors will continue to drive the gaming audience away, and only produce arcadey, disposable MP games the likes of Overwatch, which is also heavily hyper-feminized and shoving the neo-marxist agenda down your throat.

Games,"I know there are quite a few genre, most common ones are FPS &amp; TPS &amp; even some 2D Platformers, and there are also some less action games like Strategy (Plant vs Zombies) or Point &amp; Click Walking Dead.

So i'm wondering for each category, what are you favorite games? It's more about official games but if you have some zombie mods on the list feel free.

I like State of Decay but the nature of the save file means a glitch could ruin the whole progress, but it gave a nice feel as you can drive around in vehicles and carry things on it.

I tried Dying Light but really didn't know what to do as the game is so massive with many RPG elements, side stories etc, it's like Fallout and you either go one way or the other.

Resident Evil series are no brainer for TPS. I don't know about Dead Island, I tried to give Dead Rising a shot but the 1st game was pretty tiring with repetitive moves &amp; having to go back &amp; forth the same location.

COD Zombies is more about wave survival it's fun but doesn't bear much story.

L4D is fun but pretty arcadish and lack of official scenarios means you have to go with mods but most folks play the official maps.

HL series is good but more of a shooter than survival.

Zombie(U), well, the limited actions you have means it can become repetitive &amp; boring, the narrow FOV gave me headache so i couldn't progress.

Last of Us is more story &amp; experience oriented. Less about Survivor &amp; resource.

Then we have official Zombie ports for Sniper Elite &amp; Red Dead Redemption.

No More Room In Hell is an FPS worth mentioning that it captures the survivor feel but it can be difficult at times and mechanics are wonky just like RE1.

There are many other games that i never played like Dayz,  Planescape Torment, Project Zomboid,  Stubbs the Zombie, 7 Days to Die, we even have Lightgun games like House Of Dead series.

And I'm not sure if Siren Blood Curse qualifies, but it's one hell of a survivor game.

Games,"  

Let me introduce myself at beginning. I am Toto who is a team member of Drodo Studio. 

We did read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/ag3rxh/dota\_auto\_chess\_developer\_is\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/ag3rxh/dota_auto_chess_developer_is_selling/) . From beginning to the end. Every sentence, every word. 

Originally, we don’t want to say anything about it since we need more time to focus on game itself. 

However, since more and more players are talking about it, we feel must say somethings here. 

Basically, we agree most of points in this article except which about our country China. But that is not the topic here. I believer that both article poster and us are agree that developers and creators should get feedback for their products. That’s for sure. 

Now let me share something which most of you guys don’t know. Our studio created on 2015. First game is GemTD. We had payments issue even since from that time. Honestly, we want to sell shells and candies in Dota2, even though Valve will get much higher than 30% as most of you guys said (that’s because of currency exchange rate). The reasons as here: 1. Right now, every order from Ebay need manually send it out. I must suck too much time to do it. If we can use those time for the game, it is much more valuable. 2. Ebay also charge our selling fee and month fee. So why don’t we contribute those money to dota community? 

We tried to contact Valve about it when we made GemTD. Unfortunately, we did not get any reply from Valve. I totally understand it. At that time, compare with those small amount income, Valve may need contribute more for customer service, technical support and others which even us don’t know if they accept our application. Although Valve bring a lot of fun to us, they are not a charity organization. You cannot expect they ignore profit and loss to do business – even thought this game. 

Furthermore, Valve already contribute a lot to Dota2 custom game – Source 2, technical support, saver, dota2 platform, etc. See nearly everything except money. We shouldn’t ask more, should we?  

Back to this topic, I am sure we can use those couriers based on Valve policy. Valve has profit share agreements with creators. Whether include custom games? I don’t know. But at least creators can earns money from Dota2 sales for sure. While, we have nothing. Only one of our 5 team members has full time job. If we don’t sell shell/candy on Ebay, we will worry about survive.  This is life. Only enthusiasm and air are not enough to make a game, even plus water\^\_\^. I agree that’s about ethics. But the standard which use for big companies like Valve and Blizzard to us may not fair. For me, it sounds like talking ethics to a hungry person. 

This is actually an old issue for ever dota2 custom game creator. But nobody really notice or care about it before. Our case is good one to fix this issue. I obviously want to work with Valve together to build up a system which can make custom game creators earn some money. Because once it build up, more and more creators will glad to create and launch their games on Dota2 custom game. If that become true, compare with Auto Chess itself, that are bigger contributions we made to worldwide Dota2 community.

All in all, thanks for all you guys love and supports to Auto Chess. What happened in past 11 days are really amazing. We will keep updating to make Auto Chess better. If you have any idea about game or want to report bugs, you can find us by:

For most of them, that just means making things vaguely Victorian themed, or completely misunderstanding the meaning of the term and [dropping Cthulhu and co. in as enemies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DyRxlvM9VM).  PC Gamer ran an article today exemplifying the current [Lovecraft fatigue](https://www.pcgamer.com/screw-lovecraft-lets-talk-about-other-horror-universes-games-could-explore/) in the press.  


I feel like, to a certain extent, using H.P. Lovecraft's work as a starting point is primarily a quick way to achieve a certain aesthetic, and provide a snappy marketing buzzword.  ""This game isn't horror, it's *Lovecraftian Horror*.""

  
I love the way a game like *Eternal Darkness* uses the full breadth of tools available to create uncertainty and fear in the player, challenging their sanity, even going so far as to &gt;!""delete"" your save games!&lt;.  That isn't to say that every Lovecraftian game needs to break the fourth wall, just that it's an interesting way to challenge the sanity of the player and move the horror outside of their ability to comprehend in terms of repeated mechanics.  Once the horrifying elements of a game are constrained to predictable game mechanics, they become dramatically less frightening.  For this reason, I believe Amnesia succeeds very well in the first half of the game.  However, once you find yourself encountering monsters regularly, they become a nuisance -- mechanical obstacles to avoid rather than abstract terror.

  
Looking at the trailers for Death Stranding, they seem to capture the essence of terror in the face of powerful dark forces beyond comprehension, though the game hasn't been billed (to my knowledge) as Lovecraftian.  Of course, it won't be until after release that we'll be able to see how it turns out, but I'm cautiously optimistic given the horrifying strangeness of the trailers.

Games,"hi r/games. I've been trying to expand my horizons a bit when it comes to RPG games that involve auto attacking. 

Almost every game I know that has it has character builds centered around getting as much DPS from auto attacks as possible, and make it the primary source of damage for those builds. 

What I'm not understanding is the mentality behind that, and what makes it fun. I've always played builds that involve active abilities that do stuff. Auto Attacking to me seems like you could just turn on whatever buffs you need, equip whatever gear you need, and have the character go auto attack the target; then you as the player can set the controls down and leave the room or something. Obviously there's something that I'm missing here and am hoping the people here who enjoy these types of builds can elaborate to me how and where they find the fun in auto attacking.

I get that it's frequently the build with the highest DPS. But if in that same game you can have something with viable or comparable DPS, then I always gravitate towards those builds instead.

Games,"Ok so I'm a newer broadcaster and content creator. I broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming. I'm just so bored with fortnite, pubg and and all of those over saturated games. I have also recently started working on designing and creating my own old school rpg. I thought about Doing retro replays and build a game days.

Basically retro replays will be a fan or viewer could donate $1 to pick an old school game from sega, snes, or nes that I play for an hour.

Build a game days will be days where when I work on my game on my broadcast and donations could get people's ideas, characters, or shops, and side stories into my game.

I want to build a broadcast/stream that involves my viewers, not just have them watch, but actually involves them. I want to be a show for the people not for myself. I enjoy making people laugh and smile, I want to make them think, and I want to get people to appreciate video games again.

Games,"Fighting games often have different modes because not everyone wants the same thing in a fighter but the problem of perception comes in when all those modes are seperated. often the only way to tell if anybody is even playing the same game is if you chose to wait around in a lobby and experience that I would consider one of the least fun aspect of a fighting game the waiting for a match. Because of that this mode often isn't that populated meaning even if people are playing the same game you don't get to see that and the game can often look dead if even a few people step out to train or play arcade. Since fighting game numbers are often very low in comparison to most online games and training plays a huge roll in them this and can often make your player count look worse than it actually is.

FighterZ fixes that problem with a very simple solution, by keeping everyone together no matter the mode they're playing as long as they chose to play online. lobbies that should have been in the 10s ended up being in the 20s because it counted all the players who were training, playing arcade, etc... and you could do anything while still searching for a match.

While it's true this can't stop fighters actually dying it probably can improve their lifespan for quite a bit and if it is financially and technically possible I think it should be incorporated in as many fighters as possible from here on out.

I had to go to the police afterwards and explain myself. Later that day I contacted Denuvo themselves and offered them a peacful resolution to this problem. They can't say anything for sure yet, but they said the final word is by the prosecutor of my case.

Games,"With GamePass and EA Origin Access allowing gamers a Netflix style consumption option, do you find yourself preferring that method or do you prefer purchasing games outright? 

For myself, I consume all my movies and TV through subscription services and love it. If I really enjoy a series or movie, I’ll go out of my way to buy it outright. With trying it out with EA and Xbox, I am loving it so far. 

I do understand that owning is ultimately better for the consumer but, with digital games, do we really own them? I worry about the longevity of some services that we buy games on - who knows what the future holds. 

Thoughts?",Would you prefer to purchase games (digital or physical) or consume by subscription?
Games,"Let's use Battlefield or Call of Duty for examples. And let me clarify, when I say ""historically accurate,"" I'm talking only in terms of setting, uniforms or weapons, as opposed to realistic gameplay - something neither franchises have to offer. I know there are plenty of more popular realistic shooters out there, such as Squad or Rising Storm 2, which features both realistic player equipment and gameplay, but that's not what I'm discussing here.

For the past 10 years, FPS fans have been spoiled with countless weapon gadgets, optics and attachments with which to mount on their weapons. Virtually every major first person shooter featured these upgrades ever since the release of CoD 4 in 2007. Sometimes, the attachment and upgrade system comes at the cost of historical authenticity, (a hotly debated topic nowadays for some other reasons.) Battlefield 1 &amp; 5, Call of Duty World War II, and to a lesser extent, Call of Duty World at War featured some truly zany attachments, such as reflex sights and machine gun silencers, that would have never saw military issue in the first place. While reflex sights were invented as a hunting aid in 1900, and saw use aboard aircraft since 1918, it wasn't until the late 70s or early 80s at the earliest when elite special operations troops started getting them, and not until the very late 1990s when frontline grunts were equipped with such optics. Examples include the dual sighting system on the German G36, introduced around 1997, and the US Army's aimpoint red dot scope, which was accepted into service for the infantry in 2000.

The same could be said about soldier customization and cosmetics. Especially with the colorful flying circus that is CoD WW2's multiplayer, the strange superhero cape-wearing soldiers in BF1 and the seemingly un-uniformed, quasi-dieselpunk BF5 characters.

What would be the consequences of releasing say, a ""Battlefield 6"" set in an 1988 standoff between NATO and Soviet forces in Europe, with HISTORICALLY ACCURATE soldier loadouts? For example: the US Assault class will grant you a M16A1 or a M16A2, with absolutely nothing attached to it other than the quintessential (removable) bayonet? What if DICE sought to give every class the same basic camouflage uniform? What if the only character customization options were rolled sleeves, backpacks and goggles? How would this reversal, lack of customization for the sake of historical authenticity go over with the gaming community?","How would the gaming community, and the general public react to a ""historically accurate"" AAA shooter?"

There was once a period of time known as ‘The Age of Fairy Tales’, where all the worlds that you have seen in previous Kingdom Hearts games were all connected and can be traveled to by using lanes between – portals conjured by Keyblade wielders. They all bathe in the glorious light of Kingdom Hearts, free from the darkness that consumes everything. In Daybreak Town, the hub of Kingdom Hearts 𝛘, there lived a man that is responsible for looking after this world – the Master of Masters – who is able to look into the future by removing his eye and looking through it. By doing this, he created a book of prophecies. Knowing that one day he would disappear, the master of masters shares five copies of the book of prophecies, and gives them to five of his six apprentices. Written inside the book of prophecies, it is written that light will expire, and the world will be covered in darkness.

2) are there scary high pressure scenes (like running away from monsters)

Games,"The popular opinion seem to be that PC gaming is superior: highest framerate, build customisability of a PC, slightly superior graphics, mods. Sue me, but I am here to tell you while these points are true *they are absolutely neglible by almost all gamers*.

* **Ease of use**: I can put a disk in a console and it just works. I do not have to care for drivers or bugs or lags. I never, ever have to tinker with graphics settings to make the game work. The game just works as intended instantly.

* **Comfortability**: Highly underrated aspect. It is vastly superior for me to be able to lay down on my sofa with a wireless controller with a blanket all cozy and comfy than to sit at a chair and a hard desk and control everything with a mouse and keyboard. I sit at a desk with a mouse at work. I do not want to be in that position when I game or when I watch a movie.

* **Build issues**: I have to make sure my PC components are good enough or else the game will lag. This doesnt happen on a console. 

* **Price**: A decent gaming PC costs at least 1K, a cheaper one will have modern games lag while a modern game on a console just runs perfectly. Sure it might be a bit less graphically impressive and lower fps but most people do not care for the difference as long as it is playable. A console costs around 200 bucks and I can use it for a whole generation of games, around 8 years.

* **Security**: A console never gets a virus, malware. The games just work, instantly.

These aspects make console gaming vastly superior to almost all people who want to enjoy a good videogame. Believe it or not, most people who want to play a videogame *just want to play a videogame*. They do not want to spend time with tinkering with every last setting on a PC to squeeze every last frame out of a game. Most people dont care, most people prefer the comfortability of a console. 

I come home with a new game, crash on the sofa comfortably and press play on the controller and I am in the game. PC can never beat that. 

You are now welcome to crucify me, PC elitists. And they did.

",Console gaming is superior to PC gaming to the vast majority of gamers.
Games,"The EA games certainly are, but considering that [some developers don't update their games at all on GOG or the patches arrive with a delay of months](https://www.gog.com/mix/games_that_treat_gog_customers_as_second_class_citizens) it seems impossible that Origin would have an up-to-date selection. PC games commonly are tied to Steam-specific features and stripping or converting all functionality for another platform is demanding.

[Origin Access](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/origin-access/vault-games) has a large library of third-party games and I certainly don't want to be playing versions which haven't been updated since their Origin release.",Are Origin games always updated to the latest version?
Games,"I do not know if anyone else has thought of this but I recently was playing games by Rockstar and I thought of something when it comes to NPC interaction with the player. In all Rockstars open world titles, (RDR, GTA, LA Noire), NPCs constantly comment positively on the player walking around in the world. People seem to feel this is immersive, but am I the only one that think this is a very awkward way of handling NPC interaction? Examples:

* RDR: ""Theres that John Marston who shot and killed x"" or ""THATS JOHN MARSTON""
* LA Noire: ""Theres that cop that solved that case, hes handsome""
* GTA: The news radio constantly comments on everything you do and where you are in the story, making you feel like the center of the gameworld, even though it may be some insignificant mission.

Am I the only one who thinks its extremely awkward that in a open world, every NPC would know who the player is just by something that happens in the story? I mean dont get me wrong, I like NPC interacting dynamically with the player, but walking around in a world and every second NPCs know who I am and comments on me? Isnt that a little awkward? What makes it more awkward is these kind of one-liners that NPCs pull in Rockstar games often come from single NPCs. Why would a single person on a street start talking to themselves saying ""There is that brave detective, he is a handsome fellow"".

Maybe I am going in a weird direction with this, as I have not seen this discussed before. I somehow think Rockstar overdo NPCs reactions to the player, making it actually more unrealistic than if the NPCs would just talk about their stuff and never mention you?",I think games like GTA by Rockstar tend to overdo NPC to player interaction to the point of being awkward and unrealistic.

Games,"I keep seeing this whenever a game or DLC of a game is really low quality. Or when the game is no longer getting the support the community thought. It goes something like this:

1) Underwhelming/ underperforming content or some post-release fuck up by the game devs

2) Justified criticism based on an examination of current value at the time. In other words, people recognize there's a bad current value proposition.

Current e.g. Vermintide 2 DLC being pretty underwhelming. 10$ DLC (more than past dlc for V1) with less content than before. And the content isn't even guaranteed; it's locked behind a grind AND rng lootboxes so you may in fact never get all the items you paid for. This is on top of the fact the DLC is over 4 months late.

3) Apologists come out citing their $/hour ratio. Like 400 hours in a 30$ game. Or 1000 hours in a 60$ game. etc etc. They use this to justify their purchase of the DLC or ""supporting the devs"".

**Sunk cost fallacy: Considering costs that have no effect on the *value* of the decision at hand. These costs are thus irrelevant. Examples include overhead and already incurred costs**

For gaming, the purchase price of the game and thus the $/hour ratio are **sunk costs with regard to future purchases or value propositions related to the game**

Examples: 

*""Should I spend more time on this game even though I'm not satisfied? I already spent so much time and/or money""*

*""Does a low $/hour ratio justify a game's development being poor recently? I already spent so much time and got value before""*

These justifications have no bearing on current/future decisions to ""invest"" *additional* time or money into the game. And tbh, game devs and studios KNOW this and leverage this against young gamers, who don't know any better. THAT is where marketing buzzwords like ""pride and accomplishment"" and ""create your own story"" and ""our players invest themselves into our game!""

They are trying to get you to justify poor economic $ value decisions based on ""other irrelevant"" costs you have already incurred: time, emotional, identity investment. 

Stop giving them the benefit of the doubt and stop justifying bad game development, overpriced content, and bad quality content just because you ""have gotten its worth"" or ""need to get its worth"".",Sunk cost fallacy: Those who cite their past $/hour ratio in order to justify bad value decisions regarding the state of the game or purchases

Absolutely hate the first person camera they went with. I think the game could be playable if it was in third person. Also the game has a ton of still images that I feel are needed for the game overall but will wreck havoc on my Oled.  Most new games have ways to make that less of an issue but with all the information I saw in the video game play. I dont think you can hide all that or would ever want to. 

I will still pick it up and give it a try though. Been a fan of them so far and they may change my mind after I play it but as of right now. I am no longer excited for the game. Wondering if anyone else feels the same or am I the only crazy guy. ",Cyber Punk 2077 possible failure?
Games,"I think it would be really cool if there was a Marvel Universe open world game that was set in realism. For example, picture a none-futuristic-looking Cyberpunk 2077 open world, but the game would look as real as Cyberpunk looks though, set in today’s time, and your character would be in 3rd person, not 1st. Anyway, here’s my idea of the game:

It would be an open world game with different districts. You would start off the game with creating your own unique superhero or villain character that you’ll be roaming with. You’ll be able to create your own unique skillsets and powers based off other heroes/villains. You’ll be able to upgrade your skills/powers, and costume-look throughout the game.

In this game, you’ll be able to recruit other heroes or villain characters (based off whether you chose for your character to be a hero or villain). You can’t recruit heroes if you’re a villain, and vice-versa. 

Let’s say you decided to be a hero. You’ll be able to go around and recruit different hero characters, that are set in different districts of the world. You could be roaming around the city, and walk into a pub, and see a person that’s sitting at the bar drinking a beer, smoking a cigar, and has a unique hairstyle that we all know, you walk up to him, and it’s LOGAN. You start talking to him, trying to recruit him, but he’s a little stubborn as we all know Logan can be at times, so it’s hard to sway him to recruit him, and this is where your “street cred”, or “hero cred” comes into place. If your hero cred level is not high enough to recruit Logan, then he’s going to reject you (“Scram Bub, you’re not worth my time”). To build your credibility, you’re gonna have to go out and fight crime, save people, defeat enemies, etc, side mission type stuff. When you build up enough cred, you’ll be able to recruit certain heroes, and some will require higher cred levels than others. When you recruit heroes, you’ll be able to enter certain missions against certain boss villains, that give out certain rewards. Certain missions will require a certain collective squad power level, and others might require just you and another hero, or 2 other heroes, at a certain power level, and so on. Throughout these missions, you’ll face bigger and badder MCU villains, your character will start to get better gear, more powers unlocked, etc. You’ll start going from an amateur hero, all the way up to a legendary or iconic hero. A cool little ability that you could have, is to “call a hero”. For example, if you’ve recruited Spiderman, and you’re having a hard time in one of your side missions, you could call Spiderman, and he’ll swoop in and start helping you, but once you call for help, you won’t get as much credibility for that mission, as you would’ve, if you defeated it by yourself. And you only get 1 “call a hero” a mission.

Before you go into each district of the open world, you’ll be able to pull up the map, and see which heroes are in them, and the ones you might run into on the street, buildings, etc. Logan tends to be in bars, so you can go looking in every bar in the district until you run into him. Peter Parker might just be walking around the neighborhood in the district that he’s in. When you meet hero characters, you’ll be able to see their abilities, and what they can offer you and whatnot. Also, when you meet hero characters, they’ll be in normal street clothes, and go by their normal names, but when you go into battle with them, they’ll change into their hero uniforms, and there’ll be a cool cinematic transition when they change into their uniforms before each battle or mission. You’ll see Bruce Banner “hulk-out” for example. There’ll be a cool panoramic shot of the squad as the characters transform into their uniforms as well, like in the 1st Avengers movie, but they didn’t “change” though lol, that’ll be in the game.

When recruiting, it’ll be hard to recruit heroes like Spiderman, or Iron Man, or Thor, etc, because they will be considered “iconic” heroes. You would need to build your credibility really high to get them. You would be able to recruit C-level heroes in the meantime though, like Hawkeye (I kid I kid lol), but you’ll be able to recruit C-level heroes though.

You’ll be able to progress through the game, defeating lower level MCU villains, all the way up to making your hero squad strong enough to be able to take on Thanos, and that would take a WHILE, to leave you with endless hours of gameplay, recruiting, and progressing to become an ICON, and face Thanos one day.

There would be an online mode to this game as well, but I’ll be typing a book at that point if I went into it lol. I guess you could consider what I said being the ‘storymode’.

Just thinking about the idea of this game kills me, because I know it will never happen…

Games,"As someone who has had a recently renewed interest in portable gaming, I think there is a lot to be discussed. 

With the Nintendo Switch, portable gaming has been a hot topic. As someone who frequents /r/3DS there has been a lot of discussion regarding true portability. While there are many who own both systems, the 3DS still holds a niche market and is preferred over the switch by a lot of 3DS owners (while of course I understand that the reverse can be said). The main competitor of course is the Vita, yet it is common to find 3DS owners with both, or at least interest in both. 

Given the recent events between crossplay with Microsoft and Nintendo and excluding Sony, I think that a streamlined PS Vita 2 could do very well. As a cheaper alternative to the switch, a Vita 2 could hold it’s own in the market, especially if they lower the entry price point and give it the focus and accessibility that consumers really want. If it is versatile in memory (not being bound to specific memory cards) and improves upon quality of use over the PS Vita, it doesn’t need to have graphics to match the Switch at all! 

Any thoughts on this? I really think it would be a great time for Sony to focus on this, especially given how ahead of the game they’ve been doing this year in its titles and selling. By keeping up this momentum, they could have a very big influence on the gaming world. ",Discussion on Portable Gaming

Completed : Shank (co-op mode) 

The first single screen Co-op game I had played in a long time. 
Made me remember how fun they are although doesn't do complete justice to the genre.

Traditional beat em up side scroller with fluid modern combat and sharp comic style presentation. 


It not only fails to escape the problems of most beat em ups where the combat is bound to be repetitive after some time, 
but it also adds to these problems with lack of any progression and a few control issues of its own.

Wish the whole main game was made for Co-op only instead of a short separate one.
Individual special power ups and different abilities could have made coordination more appealing which was limited to only dividing the direction of attack and double team moves when needed. 



What made the grind worth it were well designed tough boss fights at the end of each mass-slaughtering level which required creativity, patience and finally lots of teamwork. 


Overall, Shank is a game which makes you work hard together in return for a slightly dull campaign but not without satisfying,tricky and fun boss fights.

Games,"I've been playing some of the final fantasy remakes and have recently started on the PC port for Chrono Trigger, and one thing stuck out to me in regards to the combat, a retroactive addition to the remakes and remasters, the inclusion of an auto battle feature.  


I'll be the first to admit that some of the older final fantasy games had relatively boring combat until you either got much later in, or fought a boss, and Chrono trigger is just easy. But after I looked up how many games have options for you to tweak involving automating your turn in a turn based rpg, or one using the ATB system, it was a bit concerning. Whenever a turn based system is put in place, it's effectively giving the player an infinite amount of time to decide what might be the course of action, to think things over and figure out how to win this fight the most efficient way possible. If your game is easy enough that the player can automate the fight and not bother with combat at all until they hit a roadblock in the form of some boss monster, is it bad game design? RPGs tend to be split between story and combat in 50/50 chunks, so if one half of the game is safely ignored by the player, is that a good thing? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd argue that the problem isn't the automated combat option, I'd say it's a problem with the core combat design itself. If it's easy enough to just allow the computer to constantly repeat the same commands you put in every turn, or just use the basic attack command over and over, then it isn't taking advantage of the time you're given to mull over your options during your turn, and it isn't giving you enough of a challenge to bother thinking about, thus, you automate the fight to save on time and move on. If the games combat was harder, or allowed you to win fights much faster by using tactics (inflicting debuffs, exploiting enemy formations, having enemies possess a weakness that needs to be exposed before it can be exploited, etc), or if you just had more effective options to hand at any given moment, then you'd be far less likely to automate the fight unless you were in a low level area with high level characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I'm not decrying against AI controlled party members, like those seen in, say, xenoblade chronicles or dragon age. Partly because they are action rpgs and controlling three characters at once in a system like that can be a tad difficult without a pause option, and partly because those games aren't turn based, or use a ATB system. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious what other peoples stances are on this, what their thoughts are on having an automation option for combat in rpgs, whether they are for or against it and so on.",Is it an admission of bad game design if you have an auto battle feature in your rpg?

as for rimworld, I find its survival element to be constantly asking for player interaction however, i like how it handles the automation of the workload but was looking for something a little bit more forgiving

for crusader kings 2, the biggest problem that i have is the lack of interesting things that happens unless you actively participate in intrigue and diplomacy in addition to the steep learning curve it kinda throws me off after a while

for the sims franchise what i dislike about it is that it is really lacking in terms of its automation because of how sims tends to do things just based on their needs and such and this in turn also removes interesting things as well.

If you die and killed by a computer soldier or monster you just die and fight again the monster and not committing the same mistake. In other words, you must have a sense of history.

[https://imgur.com/a/jEepOFE](https://imgur.com/a/jEepOFE)

In 1993, 25 years ago, games costed around $50 - $65. Adjusting just for inflation, and not rising production and marketing costs, those games would cost $75 - $100 in 2010. Now, I realize that retailers took more liberty in raising prices back then to make a profit than they do now, but there is still a dramatic difference between then and now.

Even with older retail practices considered, why the hell are we still only paying $60 for games in 2018?!

People wonder why publishers nickle-and-dime us in paid games, or why most AAA games have three editions around $60, $80, and $100 (which is about what games should cost based on inflation)? Well, creating games costs exponentially more now than it did 25 years ago... but the base price of games hasn't increased in almost just as long. Why is this? Movie ticket price have tripled in that time. Fast food and grocery prices have doubled.

I wonder if we would have such an issue with microtransactions and special editions if the price of games continued to rise instead of freezing in place around 15 years ago. It seems to me like studios and publishers have all these other ways to squeeze money out of consumers because they are selling their games at a loss and need to make up that loss somehow. What if we actually paid what games were worth, and that was it? What if games were sold for a profit at the start?

With my pride, I'm not one to be offended easily, and the points I want to make following my preface have nothing to do with my subjective opinion about homosexuality that is depicted in Odessy. My goal is to critisize Ubisoft for choosing to include it in a non-historical manner.

I've played through a few of the lesbian romance options available, and I must say, this romance option seems very casual for how not-casual it was in actual history.

Long story short, the thing you need to know is that homosexuality was very much common in ancient Greece, even among males. So contention against ubisoft for including it in the game as some sort of gay conspiracy is bullshit.  Any history professor will tell you same-sex intercourse was actually very common place among Greeks at the time Odessy is set in. It wasnt considered an orientation back then. If you were a man, and slept with another man, nobody would think twice about what that meant.

However, that's not to say gay sex didnt come with judgements from greek society. 

The person who was penetrating wasnt thought ill of, but the person being penetrated was judged not dissimilar from current day judgements of homosexuals.

I was planning to do so for the free trial plus a month, and after that I could decide if it's worth paying for a subscription or not, based on the fun I have in SoT. Well, turns out I can cancel it even before the trial runs out, because it seems I have seen everything of the game after 3 sessions already.

I mean, wow, the overall visuals are nice and the waves and weather effects are just stunning! So we went on \~10 treasure hunts and quickly found out there's ONLY skeletons. Okay, off to these skull cloud forts and literally anything that sounds like a challenge. But it's so boring. PvE I mean. So with a fortune we managed to purchase...skins. That's all that is in the game. Skins for all the equipment. Ok PvP it is, then.

And we had a whole lot of fun when our ship got stolen from the shores while we were out digging up some treasure. Had to pursue the thief with a small rowboat and it all cumulated in a fight that was...well...kinda boring. We played a bit of Blackwake earlier, so we were kind of underwhelmed with the options and realized it's probably all about RP. 

So we desperately pursued the PvP aspects of the game and realized it's merely about who hits the other ship first. Melee is a joke and you have all three ranged weapons available at your ship at all times. 

This can't be it!? We spent another few hours in it trying to find and see what makes the game shine and it's really \*\*nothing\*\* but the engine itself. The waves entertain you the most. Followed by being able to make music together, funny for about 1-2 minutes. The PvP is boring unless you're super into pirate roleplaying. The PvE is like a mobile game with the enemy's AI/variety/startegy being absent. There is no grind, unless you really need those new shoes, beards or ship paint skins. So there's no progression at all. And even if you go after the skins it's merely the go-to-here-return-here-quests that give you cash. Sure, stalk your prey for a while and steal their treasure eventually. But what for? For the rank/skins?

This game is like a 5 star luxury hotel from the outside, but as soon as you try to enter it you realize it's a massive, beautifully painted brick.

On /r/Seaofthieves it seems it's about people being mad about others enforcing PvP and pirate stories. The official forums seem to be filled with people ""justifying"" the game's existence and how all the content patches briefly delivered more content (though no one really can put his finger on it).

Such a disappointment. Had to leave this here to vent.",Sea of Thieves has been the biggest disappointment I ever experienced
Games,"I've really been struggling in recent months to find YouTube channels that simply *discuss* aspects of the gaming industry/community, mainly because it seems most gaming channels are basically Let's Play channels that occasionally post discussion videos. Of course, I've got no issue with YouTubers who just play games for their audience - I see the value, especially as a means of getting an extended look at how a game plays beyond what a trailer or brief review can show. 

However, I watch a couple of channels (Jim Sterling and DYKG) that consist primarily of discussion, and I've been basically consuming these channels' videos like podcasts during my morning commute. Unfortunately, two channels can only output so much content, and I've been looking for other channels that talk about games/gaming and the industry in order to fill the gaps between my current subscribed channels' releases.

With all that in mind, I thought it would be helpful to make a recommendation thread for this sub's favorite discussion-based YouTube channels - not just for me, as I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds it difficult to find the ""right"" YouTubers amongst millions. I've personally not seen one of these kinds of threads here before, so hopefully this isn't overly redundant or against the rules.",What are your favorite gaming YouTube channels that discuss games rather than play them?

Games,"In the past few years, I've noticed several multi-game franchises that kind of quickly became popular, in terms of sales:

* **Monster Hunter World** is probably the biggest example, even becoming Steams seventh highest ever ""concurrent players"" game
* **Yakuza**, with Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami bringing a lot of new fans into the fold so that Yakuza 6 sold the same number in West as it did in Japan
* **Persona,** arguably, with 2+ million sales worldwide, with 1+ million in the west IIRC.  Though it was already gaining attention with Persona 4.
* **NieR** with Nier Automata, though it may be hard to call this a franchise with only two games, the earlier Drakengard games are somewhat related.
* **Xenoblade Chronicles 2,** perhaps, with one million units sold in the West on Switch

Most of these franchises feature a pattern of ""long running series in Japan, that eventually generates enough attention in the West"".  Sometimes it's just word of mouth, a different platform, or maybe some design changes to make it more friendly to western audiences.  The Souls series (Demon/Dark/Bloodborne) may also be an earlier example of this, or going further back, what Final Fantasy 7 did for the FF series.

There are probably other examples, perhaps some western franchises that just grow in popularity very quickly after an initial slow start, though few come to my mind.  The biggest would probably be Saint's Row, with the relatively niche SR1 exploding in popularity by the time SR3 arrived.  Perhaps Assassin's Creed with AC 2 is another example?

**So I'm curious, what game franchise do you think will be next to quickly rise in popularity, particularly in the West?  And why?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had hoped that **Dragon Quest XI** might help attract more players to the franchise, and it has, but we haven't heard any ""1 million+ sales in west"" reports.  So it seems more likely that DQ XI is of similar level as DQ 8 or 9 and not the breakthrough hit I thought it might be.

As a long time fan of Yakuza and Persona going back to PS2 era, I always hoped these games could be enjoyed by more people.  Not just because it meant more games coming to the West, but because I honestly thought that there were a lot of gamers who might enjoy it but were missing out.

Dragon Quest feels a bit similar to me.  Many current JRPG fans have become somewhat specialized, and enjoy intricate turn-based gameplay systems like Octopath Traveler or Persona 5, which is typically how we see the turn-based subgenre evolving.  At the same time, other fans of JRPGs may prefer more action-based systems like Final Fantasy XV or Nier Automata.

So I worry it's easy for Dragon Quest to get overlooked by more casual story fans who would like to an engaging but ultimately traditional fantasy story.  Or with fun but somewhat simple gameplay.  The graphics might make people think it's an anime-style story with crazy hijinks, which can upset both people who want that sort of game and also turn away fans who might enjoy it.  So I think DQ may stay somewhat niche for now.

Looking forward, the only other series that came to mind were maybe **Ys franchise** or perhaps **Trails in the Sky / Trails in Cold Steel**.  Ys already had a mini-revolution a few years back, with a bunch of games being ported to PSP / PSVita and Steam.  I think Ys VIII on Switch/PC had potential but was hampered by poor localization.  The ""Trails of"" series has an amazing sense of world building, with 9 mainline games all taking place in the same world, and with an abundance of NPC text.  But ultimately I think Trails will stay niche unless they do a reboot down the line.  It's still somewhat niche in Japan as well, so perhaps it's not too surprising.

One other longshot would be the **Gundam** franchise.  There is a live action gundam movie made by Legendary Pictures coming in 2019 or 2020, and if that somehow engages a western audience, then I could see the games taking off.  But it could be a Dragonball Evolution (live action anime) type situation.

Thus I was curious if there are any other franchises that others have enjoyed but also feel that it might be ready to burst onto the scene.  I thought this might also give me a sense of new franchises to check out.  Thank you and sorry for the long wall of text.

**tl;dr: Some long running franchises, often from Japan, have become very big recently in the West.  What do you think will be the next one to do so?**",What franchise do you feel is just waiting to burst in popularity?

**CGMagazine** - Jed Whitaker - [5.5 / 10.0](https://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/sea-of-thieves-xbox-one-pc-review/)

&gt;Sea of Thieves feels like a game that should be offered for $10–$20 tops as an early access or game preview product. There just isn't enough content or depth here, its core gameplay is grinding repetitive fetch quests and not a whole lot else, the progression here just isn't fulfilling, and fun factor depends on who you're playing with.

**Cheat Code Central** - Sean Engemann - [4.1 / 5.0](http://www.cheatcc.com/xboxone/rev/seaofthievesreview.html)

&gt;Sea of Thieves plots a course in the opposite direction of most big budget, predictable affairs. Loot is not about gaining power, and the thrill is in the voyage, not the destination. This may alienate some gamers, but it is a breath of fresh air for those willing to embrace the change. However, Rare will soon find the community clamoring for more content and improved social options to keep players invested and using their freedom to create limitless and fascinating stories.

&gt;The skeleton fort raid is quite intense, and the Kraken encounter, while admittedly a bit lackluster, is a unique and exciting gaming experience. It's just that once the novelty of being a pirate and going on one fetch quest after another wears off, there ceases to be anything left to bring people back.

Games,"I've had Pillars of Eternity for quite a while but I finally got around putting some serious time into it (I've started over several times in the first few hours). I've put around 50 hours or so into it this playthrough in the last week and a half or so. I've really enjoyed the writing, quests, characters, and the strategy of being able to micromanage a party to my heart's content.

With Pillars of Eternity 2 just around the corner I was curious about some of the other recent games in the genre. I've heard some lackluster things about Tyranny (despite its interesting concept) and Tides of Numenaria. Divinity Original Sin II (how's the co-op?) seems like a hit, though, and I've had Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun for quite a while but have never gotten around to trying them. I figured I'd put together a list of some discussion questions to get things going.

- Are there things you prefer about old game mechanics or systems from the original CRPGs?

- What do you think about the new game mechanics in these games (Pillars of Eternity's stat system or Divnity Original Sin's environmental hazards)?

- What are the true standouts most recently?

- Do you see this trend of new CRPGs continuing?

- Do you think, or are there any good examples of, these sorts of games that could work for consoles? 

- What's an example of a really interesting, new concept you liked but the rest of the game wasn't that good?

- How do you think these games can improve in the future? What is the future of this genre, in your opinion?",What are your thoughts on the reemergence of isometric RPGs into more mainstream gaming?

Games,"My biggest issue with the Soulsborne games has always been the fact that you have to slog your way through the same enemy mobs every time you die at a boss. This always put me off because the boss is supposed to be the final challenge after you’ve already bested the rest of the level, so it was frustrating that I had to fight the enemies over and over again to get to the boss. I know you have an option to run past enemies to the boss room but imo that’s a little annoying as well. It would be nice if you could just respawn directly in the boss chamber again to face them without wasting time.

I know I may be in the minority in this but I know there are others that feel the same way. So how would you feel if HYPOTHETICALLY the remastered version allowed you to skip the enemy mobs altogether and respawn directly in the boss room?","How would you feel if hypothetically speaking, the Dark Souls remaster let you skip enemy mobs/levels after you die at a boss and just respawn to fight them again immediately?"

If I was tired but hadn't played that day yet, I'd play games instead of going to bed because I couldn't go a day without playing!

But now, it's definitely not the most important thing.

Random thoughts and practicing my writing. Excuse the formatting.. mobile here 

TLDR: 
    Do not let genres define your gaming experiences.  Find game directors you enjoy and play through their catalog of games.  Avoid hype culture, know when you are hearing gaming rhetoric vs. reality.  Do not think your games are perishable and plan out your gaming habits.  If you are partaking in a game as a service, particularly an online one, know the affects it has on you psychologically. Know yourself well enough to take a break and play something else. Focus on your mental and physical health, as well as, your social well-being (that can be your online friends as well).  We choose the games we play, not the other way around.

Genres:

Gaming genres have been defined over the years through necessity, yet gaming companies use them to pigeon-hole gaming culture into distinct categories.  This has changed the way games are viewed by publishers, made by developers and consumed by customers.  Using your current schema, think about what games come to mind when you read: FPS, RPG, JRPG, Hack and Slash, Action Adventure, Open-World.  Now think of a game you have trouble categorizing: Dishonored, Prey (2017), Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dark Souls, Catherine, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and Yakuza are a few that come to mind with me.  There are macro and micro genres at work here but they are interchangeable depending on the title you are discussing.  Gaming media and culture has come up with some other words (albeit overused, and misunderstood) to help further categorize games: immersive, emergent gameplay, roguelike and soulslike.  Yet, I struggle with the categorization of games.  I recently did some research on Immersive Sims and the origins of the term.  I wasn't able to fully digest what I came up with and I ended up blurring my perspective on genres even further.  I realized it was the semantics of the genres that bothered me.  How could Zelda: Breath of the Wild be an ""Action-Adventure Open-World"" game in the same genre as Metal Gear Solid 5 and Assassin's Creed?  The gameplay elements, while similar with their massive maps, play very differently and are not similar experiences.  Again, why was Yakuza being compared to Grand Theft Auto, as if it were a genre?  I understand the need to categorize games, if I can't generalize the main type it is, how can I make an educated purchase? However, this need for categorization has leaked into games creation, critique and consumption.  Which to me, is an issue for gaming culture.  Genres have become stereotypes/architypes with only incremental improvements.

Grandfathered in:

        There is something to be said about the monoliths of these genres.  I don't think of Halo as an FPS, I think of it as Halo.  I don't think of Dark Souls as a ""Third-person action RPG"" it's just Dark Souls.  When we have trouble categorizing something we use these game titles as categories themselves; Doom clone, Halo killer, Soulslike, GTA clone, Skyrim with guns.  Certain games define a genre but that does not mean they are chained to that genre.  How many of us have some of our favorite games of all time from a blind purchase?  That game you just picked up with no preconceptions.  After playing it and doing research on it, how well did it review? What genre is it intended to be? Is it bland in the grand scheme of things?  Many of us will play games for years, and feel empty year after year looking for a game that ""clicks"" with us.  We will play the right genre, the best reviewed, the most look forward to games.  Then we will look at our gaming shelves lined with uncompleted games and say ""I have nothing to play.""  The way genres have been defined and refined over the years leave us waiting for the next best thing after every rendition.  There are outliers, developer teams that create the games they want regardless of the genre; The Witcher 3, Persona 5, Yakuza, Nier: Automata, Prey (2017), etc.  But are they the most profitable?  Video games are consumable but we as gamers need to stop treating them as a perishable.  The homogenization and disposable concept of gaming affects the culture at large.

The Future: 

      Server based games are becoming more and more prevalent.  For Honor, The Division, and Destiny are just a few examples.  Publishers are creating perishable games to match gaming culture.  This is just as much a psychological tactic to keep you playing, as it is a way to increase the amount of continued money they can get from a game via micro-transactions.  There is also a split in the gaming community in regards to this.  Some are not adverse and prefer these types of experiences, while others feel it is a detriment to gaming as a whole.  You could even say it stems from the MMO thought process; a game that is a service and focuses on the continuous play and money of its users.  While MMOs are not a genre, I felt the need to bring it up in this topic because it seems that ""games as a service"" have been influencing the way games are being created.  Thus affecting genres and our perception of them.  Final Fantasy 15 is a good example of an offline equivalent of how ""games as a service"" have changed a development cycle of a game.  And it seems Square-Enix is dabbling in the episodic nature of this idea with Hitman.  A JRPG and a Third-Person Stealth game both being utilized as ""games as a service"" with decent levels of success.  Is it because these games are based of franchises that are staples to their genres?  That's not to say the online-only games listed above were unsuccessful, be it known they made loads of money and still are; however, the communities for these online-only seem to suffer from a level of psychological fatigue not seen in any other media outlet.  This ends up causing a disparity with what a game is and what people think a game is.  Muddling genres even farther.

Sidethoughts: 

     Through the course of my 30+ years of gaming I have come to appreciate most games, even the objectively ""bad"" ones.  I see gaming companies chasing genres.  It feels as if things have changed from, ""I want to make a game based on this idea I have."" to, ""Make a First Person Shooter and fit these parameters."" Or ""What has the highest potential to make us money?"" Does Nier: Automata only exist because it was sold on its genre?  Is that why Platinum games was brought in to handle the hack and slash elements?  Is this why we see more experimental story beats but not gameplay ones?  To tell someone they need to play Nier: Automata because it's excellent in its genre, belittles what the original Nier did when it was released.  To have it in a list of games that include Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta also does the game a disservice.  However, if you followed Yoko Taro's work you'd have a general idea of what you were getting into.  Meaning, the direction of the game defines the game more than its given genre.  Saying Todd Howard directed Fallout 3 and 4 says much more than ""Open world RPG.""  This is shown in the difference of reception of Fallout 3 and 4 vs. Fallout: New Vegas.  Other examples include but aren't limited to; the difference between Dark Souls 1 and 2, the difference between Ninja Gaiden 1 and 2 vs. 3, the difference between Devil May Cry 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 and 4 vs. DmC.  Long story short, follow directors you enjoy, not the genres their games help define.  Know what you are getting yourself into, without blindly following these monoliths and name brands.  When a new game comes out from an unknown director and the first thing they do is compare it a better known game, proceed with caution.


",Transcending Genres: Gaming's Psychological State
Games,"Feels like the genre has just completely disappeared outside of a single game.  BDO has sandbox elements, as does, ArchAge, but both are basically still just themepark MMOs with a longer feature list at the end of the day.  [Fevir put out a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMkh2Ct2Gzw) a year or so ago that pretty much sums up the way I feel about those games.  

EVE scratched the freedom/player interaction itch I wanted from a sandbox MMO, but the gameplay was just so unbearably dull that I couldn't stick with it for the long term.  Don't get me wrong, the stakes made combat tense sometimes, but I'm usually more of an action combat guy, and EVE's combat was like watching paint dry.   Plus, navigating a byzantine maze of menus just to do the simplest things got old pretty quick.    

I feel like every now and then, I see a game add in elements that have massive sandbox potential, but ultimately, they reign it in and make it more themepark\-ish so as not to confuse or turn away more casual players.  I really can't think of a single game that would scratch that sandbox itch if you're either sick of EVE or not that into it in the first place.  ",Are there really no populated sandbox MMOs right now besides EVE?

Games,"The US Dollar is getting stronger and stronger in the last years, especially in 2018. [In the beginning of the month CNN reported the US Dollar is ""getting a huge comeback""](http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/02/investing/strong-dollar/index.html) and some US companies are getting worried since many of them have business around the world. A weaker US Dollar is good for trades and for profits in their case. And This is true for gaming companies too. A stronger dollar means gaming becoming more expansive outside of the US, considering they often adjust their prices according with currency fluctuations. 

What is the the result of this? Less sales and less profit, and by proxy, less games getting localized in certain regions/languages. This won't impact US gaming market and US customers at all now, but for the rest of the world this is worrying. The gaming market still don't want to sell games at lower prices for other markets, like Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Middle-East, Asia etc. They want to sell at same price or more. In these regions gaming is already expansive in comparison with the US. Even countries like Canada witnessed the effects of it. [In 2014 Sony raised the price of PS4 in Canada from $399 to $449](https://gamerant.com/ps4-price-increase-canada-dualshock-4-camera/), thanks to US Dollar getting stronger and Canadian Dollar getting weaker.

The CNN article mentions the US Dollar could get even stronger by 2019. This could mean more price increases for a lot of gaming markets. $100 CAD for a game for Canadians? Price increase in Xbox Live and PSN again? More companies leaving countries like what Nintendo did some years ago? We don't know what the game market will do, but gaming could be more expansive to people living outside of the United States of America.

Games,"Whether you personally enjoy a good leak or not really depends on how much you like surprises. I know people who will constantly avoid any gaming news that has been leaked because they would prefer to be taken in by the official reveal rather than a pixelated twitter picture. But others, like myself, like to know all they can about a game before its release, regardless of how that information has been officially disseminated.
However, some leaks can be disastrously spoiler-ific, which can not only ruin the surprise for many who hate spoilers, but also thwarts the developers’ or publishers’ plans for how they were going to present their game leading up to its release. ",What are your opinions on video-game Leaks?
Games,"I brought up this thought experiment with a friend and it's interesting to wonder how current technology and business practices could create a new arcade environment. For example, VR headsets are still, for many people, pretty expensive. What if there were some kind of space game that had a cockpit you entered and moved around in all directions? Or what if a game that has arcade sensibilities, for example Vanquish or Bayonetta, were trimmed down to a shorter length (or even had a password system like Gauntlet Dark Legacy) and became this era's quarter munchers?

I feel like an arcade would be a no-brainer to release something like a version of Smash Bros or Street Fighter VI or whatever, too. Fighting tournaments that are broadcast on Twitch and other platforms typically do have a large gathering, so there's an audience there for the arcade.

I guess the question is, are people willing to do the quarter muncher thing in 2018? In this landscape of microtransactions where people will pay for cheap cosmetics because ""eh it's only a dollar"", I want to say, yes, most people wouldn't be phased by it. But really it's hard to tell. Could easily be seen as outdated and cumbersome.

They could pair this with a full campaign mode, like Injustice, and it could have its own canon separate from the movies and comics.

If you're a fan of Hearthstone but you hate the randomness and the card collection, or if you're a fan of Starcraft but you're just not fast enough these days, you might be interested in Prismata.

This game is the product of years of love from a bunch of math PhD nerds who dropped off everything they had because they saw the potential behind their game. I love this game and its developers and I really want them to succeed.

###GAMEPLAY

It's a bit difficult to put the game into a single genre.  

It's a hybrid turn-based strategy game taking elements from card games, RTSs, Dominion, and chess. There is no RNG, no deck building.  

Each game has a different set of units that you and your opponent can purchase. Because each set is random, no game is ever the same and you have to figure out which strategy is the best every time. Because you and your opponent get the same set of random units, it's always balanced. And because there is no RNG or hidden information in-game, each game always feels fair and has a lot of depth.

The depth of strategy involved has kept us alpha players around for years and makes for exciting games and tournaments. Even the AI was [developed by a Starcraft AI bot competition winner](http://blog.prismata.net/2014/12/17/the-prismata-ai/) and can take games from top players from time to time.

[The philosophy and design work behind removing RNG is pretty interesting if you're into game design.](http://blog.prismata.net/2014/12/02/removing-rng-eliminating-luck-can-benefit-strategy-card-games/)

###OTHER REASONS I LOVE THIS GAME

It's really free. There are no purchasable advantages. No P2W, no grinding for cards, no bullshit. Just skins, emotes, or extra single-player content and puzzles.

Also, the game has a single player story campaign which introduces all kind of weird scenarios with units you wouldn't find in PvP, similarily to Starcraft 2. The writing and characters are OK and remind me of Trauma Center. I personally like the story but it might not be your cup of tea if you don't you like sci-fi. It's a couple hours long so far, but more episodes will be released later this year. 

I'll end this with a couple of fun clips as a warning: Once you understand the game, it can be pretty addictive.

Games,"So in short, the Oldschool Runescape world is in turmoil this month after the company unfairly criticized and even threatened legal action against Runelite, a third party developer. There are others, such as the very controversial OSBuddy, which is built off a previous bot client. 


The community appears to be divided 50/50 on this issue from what I have been able to tell. 50% side with Jagex, supporting their reasoning that the open source nature revealed Runescape's source code, and allowed the possibility of cheating. However, OSBuddy was left untouched. This comes as an insult, as OSBuddy was previously a bot client, is left out of the crusade against third party clients.


What's so bad about OSBuddy? The hypocrisy. [Osbuddy used to be a bot client](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8jw413/daily_reminder_that_osbuddy_used_to_be_a_botting/?st=jhc74sxy&amp;sh=3f39a173). Jacmob was one of the most pivotal people behind the success of rsbuddy, causing Jagex hundreds of thousands in damage. However, he was spared any sort of retribution, and it was as if Jagex MAGICALLY forgot about all of it. Sure, they tried to sue him and rsbuddy based on copyright, but their case was poorly founded and they lost. In comparison, [Blizzard entertainment made an amazing case against a cheat developer and scored 8 million](https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/4/15177818/overwatch-cheat-maker-sued-loses-judgment): 


&gt; Blizzard wins $8 million judgment against Overwatch cheat maker... their sale and use damaged Blizzard's business by introducing unfair competition to games that diminished the experiences of legitimate players and discouraged others from playing. ""The in-game cheating also harms Blizzard's goodwill and reputation,"" it argued.


This is all true of Runescape, but of the botting. The in-game cheating harmed Jagex's reputation severely. Players quit RuneScape in droves because the economy was so unfair, and the game was littered with bots. But instead of making a strong enough case to do anything, they just gave up. Jacmob joined Jagex's team, and basically offered 'the antidote' to solve the problem. Fast forward to the future, now, OSBuddy is the 2nd most popular third-party client after RuneLite, which has been threatened with legal action. This was such a nasty slap in the face for players because of the facts surrounding it. Some criminal who did hundreds of thousands in damage is allowed to just jump ship, doesn't have to pay a dime in damages, and gets paid to solve the problem HE MADE? Nah, that doesn't fly with me. Blizzard would never do that. That's why Blizzard games in my opinion are better. Jagex is the EA of MMOs. They butcher players' trust by doing shady stuff like this. They just forgive this guy that did all this damage, and pretend it didn't happen. But Runelite is threatened because there's a tiny chance their program may contribute to botting? Runelite was someone abiding by the rules, never broke the law, and has been loyal to Runescape... and they're going to defend this group of criminals OSBuddy who actually did break the law? I just can't even. 

Jagex is just an incompetent company, while Blizzard, who makes WoW, is a much more sensible and more legally sound company. Just face it. Blizzard didn't go to the criminals and ask them to join Blizzard. Nope. They sued a cheat making company IN ANOTHER COUNTRY... ANT THEY WON 8 MILLION!!!! Jagex? We will hire them and pretend nothing ever happened. 


**TL;DR: Criminals ran rsbuddy, a bot client. Jagex tried to sue, but let them off scotch free and hired them. They let them become OSBuddy, built off the previous bot client. Jagex then goes on crusade against law abiding RuneLite, but ignores the criminals running OSBuddy. Blizzard, in comparison, sued cheating company and won 8 million. Jagex morally bereft.**","Jagex, developer of Runescape, allowed criminals to make a third party client, something Blizzard or other gaming companies would NEVER do"

Games," Even though we’re still in 2017, it never hurts to look at the upcoming games. In fact, if anything, it gets us all the more hyped for the games to come. 2018 has an amazing collection of Games that is headed our way, and today I’ve decided to make a list of **Most Anticipated Video Games of 2018**. [So let’s begin guys!](https://omvilita.com/)

**1. The Last of Us 2**

  The Last of Us 2 will be out on PS4, but the exact release date for the [game](https://otakukart.com/category/game/) is still unknown. Its story is based on Joel and Ellie, and is set 5 years after the original game. We really don’t know much about this game, other than the fact that the theme will be similar to The Last of Us. But, if the game is anywhere near that one, then it’ll be a blast to play! 

 **2. Spider\-Man**

 Spider\-Man is set to be released on PS4 sometime in 2018. This is by far, one of the best looking Spider\-Man games we’ve seen so far. The game doesn’t follow any storyline so basically it could go anywhere. But, it does look very interesting right now, and I know many of you are hyped for it as well. 

 **3. Red Dead Redemption 2**  
Red Dead Redemption 2 was actually set to be released this year, but it has since then been delayed back to 2018. This game has a lot to live up to, and I’m pretty certain it will deliver. Red Dead Redemption 2 is set to release in the spring of 2018, on PS4 and XBox One.

**4. God of War**  
God of War is set to be relased in 2018, as a PS4 exclusive. This game builds on the already huge world of the God of War series with minor differences. While it does feature the story of Kratos, this time, a different mythology is targeted, which is Norse Mythology. Also Kratos now has a scruffy beard. So that’s enough to get the fans excited for this one.

**5. Indivisible**  
Indivisible is set to be released in 2018, with the exact date not having been announced yet. It is going to be out on PC, PS4, XBox One and Switch. Indivisible follows the intrepid Ajna as she encounters environments and monsters inspired by Southeast Asian mythology. Sounds fun enough, right?

**6. Monster Hunter: World**  
This game, set for PC, PS4, and XBox One, by Capcom marks a new era in the series of the game. It is set in an environment where you can hunt animals like Dinosaurs and Dragons so it promises a lot of fun. I’m pretty sure that this game will be pretty sick.

**7. Far Cry 5**  
Far Cry series has always been exciting, and Far Cry 5 is set to release in 2018 for PC, Xbox One, and PS4. However, the game won’t be set in a far off place like they did with Far Cry 4, or in the stone age, like Primal. Rather it is going to be set in USA. I’m pretty sure that the game is going to be amazing. It is set for a February release date.

**8. Dragon Ball Fighter Z**  
Dragon Ball Fighter Z is set to bring greatness back the franchise of Dragon Ball XenoVerse 2. Dragon Ball Fighter Z is going to be a 2.5 D game unlike XenoVerse 2 which was a 3D. All the fans seem to be excited for this one, and I’m sure it’ll be a great one indeed.

**9. Days Gone**  
Days Gone is another Zombie game coming out way. Zombie games have really been over done, but that doesn’t matter, because PS4 exclusive Days Gone is set for a 2018 Release. Apparently, the story is going to involve humans who have infected by some sort of virus, and are eager to devour the protagonist Deacon. It does look like a decent game, and is certainly one that many are hyped for.

**10. Anthem**  
Anthem is set to be released on PC, PS4 and XBox One in the fall of 2018. While not much is known about the game yet, it is essentially EA’s answer to Destiny: a shared\-world. The game is set in a sci\-fi Universe, and we have to play as a Freelancer, who engages in third\-person shootouts. While it doesn’t have the same hype as Red Dead Redemption 2, it might actually shock quite a few people.

Which Game are you excited for in 2018?

## [Amazing Games That You Cannot Play Anymore](https://omvilita.com/)

Often the older games disappear in the gaming market. Some of them are then remade , and that’s how the next generation gets to enjoy these games, but that’s not the case with all of them. Some games just disappear, and they’re not available to be downloaded, to bought anywhere, which is a shame really, because some of them are really great. Here’s a list of Top 10 games that you cannot play anymore.

 **Halo 2 \(Online\)**  
Halo 2 is considered to be one of the greatest games of Halo series. Microsoft shut down Xbox Live in April 2010, but fans loved Halo 2 a lot. They signed in before shutdown and some didn’t even turn off their Xbox keeping Halo 2. But that didn’t last long. Even though we have Halo 2 Anniversary, it’s not the same. There are technical problems, poor matchmaking, which makes it different.

**Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes**  
Marvel vs Capcom 2 was amazing, and it was a one of a kind game. But, unfortunately, we can’t play it anymore because Capcom ceased porting the game and removed it from all online stores. The game eventually shut down in 2013, which is a very sad thing to say. I just wish we could play it more.

**The Legend Of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition**  
Zelda has always been famous. Even now, you probably spend some time playing it, assuming you own the game of course. But, this Zelda, which was a free download edition for 3DS, was special. Unfortunately, Nintendo does not offer the Anniversary Edition. However, there was also a remaster, which was available during two short time periods. But, it is largely unavailable.

**Scott Pilgrim Vs The World: The Game**  
You might already about this game, and the fact that it is based on comics. Also though it doesn’t have the text that makes the comics great, but it was pretty well liked among the fans. Unfortunately, Scott Pilgrim released digitally in 2010, and there are no physical copies of it available anymore. The Game has since then went on to disappear from PlayStation store.

 **After Burner Climax**  
After Burner Climax was a blast to play. It was a great experience to play it at home or even watch it, because this game had beautiful fight simulations. The game did spread on to Home consoles in 2010 but since then, it dropped out of both online stores, and now it is no longer in production as an arcade game, which hurt the fans all over the world very bad.

**Mario Kart Wii \(Online\)**  
Mario Kart Wii introduced a totally new dimension to its franchise, and that’s why it was so liked among the gamers all over the world. Everything about this game was beautiful, and the game itself was so fun. But, sadly, Nintendo ceased online services for all Wii and DS games in 2014, which included Mario Kart Wii. Although the game can still be played offline, you cannot play them as you once did, which is very sad.","Top 10 Most Anticipated PS4, Xbox One And PC Video Games Of 2018"

",Battlefield V - tons of new gameplay footage
Games,"Bethesda is obviously making a lot of investment in virtual reality. First, with the ports of fallout 4, skyrim, and doom in VR. At the e3 conference today, they announced VR spinoffs of prey and wolfenstein, along with Elder Scrolls Blades.

All of these ""ports"" and ""spinoff"" VR titles reminds me of how they ported skyrim to next gen to get practice building fallout 4 in the updated engine. They could be doing the same thing now, practicing implementing VR in their games so that they get it right in their mainstream titles.

Because of this, I would not be surprised if starfield and ES6 launch with VR support from the beginning, likely with much more vr implementation than their current titles!

Sure, server side mods, and other mods that don't effect gameplay may still be a thing. But other, more substantial mods. Like weapon mods, overhauls, new quests, ect. Will be impossible. 

Surely Bethesda isn't going abandon mods? They create replayability not possible with anything else. And as the creation club has shown, can be profitable. Even if the consensus is against it.

Some of my favorites are Tomb Raider, Quantum Break, Gears of War, Resident Evil, etc. I looked through the store and these are some that stood out to me/I have heard good things about. 

-Ghost Recon Wildlands
-Witcher 3 (could I jump in without playing the other Witchers?)
-Tom Clancy's The Division (The sequel at E3 grabbed my attention)
-Vampyr
-Bio Shock: The Collection (always wanted to play but never got around to it)
-Metro Bundle (2033 &amp; Last Light)

If you know any other games that might be up my alley let me know too! Thanks! ",Which games should I purchase and play on XB1?
Games,"So this comes from my recent playthrough of Skyrim again this time using special edition and some texture and lighting mods. Skyrim has got a lot of hard response from fans and many gamers for getting re-released and being a cash grab, but I think this game is worthy of all the re-releases.

**Simplicity**

There is no doubt Skyrim is the most accessible RPG in the market as of now, in the past we have had other ES titles but they had a lot of mechanics that bolstered RPG mechanics but only to become a chore with multiple breakthroughs or mods to skip these steps. The moment you are free in the game nobody asks a question what to do or how to play its very intuitive and for all ages.

The reach of skyrim and the accessibility it provides to consumers is just unbeatable by any RPG till date.

**Narrative**

The classic western depiction of dragons as villains is adopted by Skyrim in its narrative, the moment Alduin comes players know that they should kill that dragon in the end. The objective is set, no need of backtracking, no need of backstory, no history lessons, the player knows Dragon is bad=kill dragon.

The civil war and rest of the narratives are layers beneath Alduin's story and players depending upon their need can pursue it or not. This is a very great way to tell story without compromising user Agency. In the older games I remember constantly looking at wiki for terminologies and past story events from arena and daggerfall.

Skyrim can be paused by any one who doesn't even know ES lore but can still make total sense of it. The game also rewards people who already know the ES universe by allowing them to use certain dialogues and get a desired response from an NPC.

Pocket narratives are mini stories or radiant quests that again further deepens the life and culture of people around skyrim. this can be like becoming a simple thug for a merchant to helping lil kids on street who got kicked by uncle and aunt.

**A Homely World**

The world is just brimming with life, and with mods this just gets better 100X more powerful. Players actually feel like residing in the world. My recent experiences from Pillars of Eternity, Divinity which are just fabulous games and still keeps the good old RPG pure with hours of entertainment. 

The  one thing I had was I always felt I was a third person this maybe due to the isometric nature of the games, but I felt like a guest in that universe and only to finish the game and feeling yeah it was okay but not wanting to go back to those universe again.

Skyrim is heartwarming, and the whiterun music always reminds me of my actual home and the entire place oozes with character despite NPCs having Dialogue loops.

I still feel Riverwood is ready to welcome me anytime if I go there and can chop woods and earn a few spetims.

**Interaction**

The time Todd Howards talked about picking the flowers I thought yeah it just a Icon that will be added too inventory, but turns out the entire game has a very great level of interactivity. Other than witcher this is the only game where I can identify plants, animals, insects, fishes by looking at them. Especially for plants based on
their terrain they grow, and the type of flowers and leaves they have. Now I can see names popping in my head miles away when I see a patch of herbs. This ability is acquired within a manner of minutes in the game and odes not require multiple play sessions.

The hearthfire DLC  expanded this interactivity to whole new level and its was so heart warming to see the mods that emerged based around this DLC around.

Combat is another intuitive system in the game,  pres attack to attack long press attack to strong attack. There are no multiple modifiers and special moves simple but effective at the same time enjoyable. No matter how many new combat systems come skyrim combat has it own charm and still remains undefeated.

**Finding a Balance**

Skyrim has found a balance in everything a RPG can offer, for sure it lacks the depth and scale of it older counterparts (there are mods for introducing this). The game from a entertainment product feels best in its vanilla version it has everything a RPG gamer wants but not intimidating for a new pler or a newer generation.

Skyrim can be played at anytime of the year by anyone in this world and can hours hours of entertainment for ages to come. The game has aged well but the mods still make the game look like a next gen RPG and many modern games still looks bad compared to a fully modded skyrim game. 

these are just my thoughts Lets discuss  :)",Skyrim still the best RPG ever?

It’s unclear if there will be an offline option or if it’ll be like Destiny or Elder Scrolls Online where other players can be seen throughout the world.  

Regardless, online play will be an essential part of Fallout 76. Players will have an effect on the world. Everyone will be able to create their own settlements throughout the world, and rival settlements can even attack them. You can nuke them too!

This impacts services such as Parsec, LiquidSky, GeForce NOW, etc.  Either Blizzard is rolling out their own cloud service, or they are looking to partner with an official service and take their cut.  Either way, this is shitty for the end consumer.  I have been dabbling with a Cloud PC with Parsec and playing on a Chromebook/Android Phone/Crappy PC and it's actually pretty awesome.

",New info regarding Assassins's Creed: Odyssey and what the story is really about.
Games,"Mario Tennis just released and while a lot of fun, there are some very, very glaring omissions from the game. 

When playing a quick match, you cannot select the court you want to play on. You have to go to the menu and toggle every court you **don't** want to play on. Okay, weird, but whateves. 

If you wanted to play doubles with a friend online (using two separate switches) against random other players, you cannot do this. So when I bought this game with my friend who lives far away with the expectation of playing doubles together against other players... we can't. 

And most notably, you *literally* cannot play a regular game of tennis. You play a shortened version that doesn't follow the same scoring rules as tennis. Let me explain. 

For those that don't know how regular tennis is scored it's broken into Games and Sets. 

Scoring counts by 15-30-40-game. What that means is simple: the first one to score four points wins a **game**. But it's win by two. Just think of winning a **game** by scoring 4 points. 

Then you can win a **Set** by winning 6 games before your opponent. This is also win by 2. That's what a tiebreaker is and somewhat different rules. But the basic breakdown is this. 

1 Game = first to 4 points (win by 2)
1 Set = first to 6 games (win by 2)
1 Match = Best of 3 (so first to win 2 sets) (You can also have best of 5 sets). 

You can see this can take a while if both players a good and winning lots of games and sets. It can also go pretty quickly if one person wins all the games and sets. 

But here's what Mario Tennis Aces does.

Best of 3 games wins the match. That's it. No sets. Not even ONE set. Just three games. That means you can win a match by winning two games in a row. You can win an entire match in 8 points. They can happen incredibly fast and be over instantly. There are some other different scoring factors for the tiebreakers but that's the basic breakdown. 

### So why does this matters? 

Clearly, Nintendo is trying to make the matches faster so they are quick games. This is a fine *option* if people want a quick game, but for people looking to play tennis, this is not acceptable. 

Let's compare this to another sport. 

Baseball: imagine playing 1 inning and then the games over. 

Basketball: A 5-minute quarter becomes the entire game

American Football: Each side gets two attempts at offense and then it's over. 

Football/soccer: You get a 10-minute game. 

What's my point with all this? The super short gameplay takes away a lot more than just length of gameplay before needing to start a new match. 

It removes all the deep analysis you sort through when battling a tough opponent. It belittles the mental warfare you and your opponent are having as you try to outplay one another. It dispatches the adaptability of techniques you need to utilize when your opponent has figured your playstyle out. It erases the incredible comeback victories you can have after being down 90% of the match. It completely shatters the rewarding feeling of fighting tooth-and-nail for 20+ minutes to come out the victor by a tiny margin. It makes for very shallow gameplay for most matches because there isn't enough time to feel like you are developing a good strategy against your opponent. 

(Yes there are some cases where you get into long rallies with your opponent and you understand their playstyle. But this strengthens my point because it's all about the length of time you have to experience that opponent. Which, by default, the game is trying to prevent with its mini-game type gameplay. 

But most abhorrently, there is no good reason for this option to be unavailable. It's just missing. Why not give the option for a regular tennis match as least offline? Or in a custom lobby with friends? Why are we being forced to play this tiny highlight of a tennis match? I could understand some game modes requiring this format (I guess) but its glaring omission from a game about Tennis makes little to no sense. 

R/NintendoSwitch is fairly upset about this but I think it needs more attention outside of that sub.

Games,"The title says it all. In my personal opinion, there is a HUGE lack of development in games with an architectural vein to them. The only 2 really good games that have good ""architecture"" in them would be The Sims, and Minecraft.

However, both these games lack so many good features. For instance, The Sims supplies great graphics, but lacks round walls, cars, furniture models (they really don't have enough), bigger lots (limited to such a small lot doesn't enable gardening, or the construction of big mansions/shopping centres/markets), and even has a limit to how many stories you can build (if I'm not mistaken).

Then, we got Minecraft... Which let's be honest: It is all made out of blocks. Sure Minecraft allows you to build anything, if you've got enough skill (same with any other game). I've seen Minas Tirith built in Minecraft, seen Mount Doom, Rivendell, Erebor, and modern mansions like Fallingwater or even the Stark Mansion from Iron Man.

But it lacks curves, it lacks the 3D graphical advantage that other games (like Call of Duty or the Sims or whatever) have. It doesn't have custom models made for it, and it's mostly revolving around the building blocks concept.

The best balance between the two at the moment out there is Roblox... It's got a great improvement (in terms of graphics) in comparison to Minecraft, but also has all its building features - plus you can build curved walls and even custom furniture down to the last detail. But damn... Roblox is so complicated to build in. Simply due to the fact it's made for developers, not gamers. If a person is trying to create a game, then Roblox is an easy way to do it, but it really isn't easy, not for people like me, or even your average gamer.

This makes it extremely difficult (at least for someone like me) to build. I've played Sims 3 with mods, Sims 4, with mods too, I've played Minecraft, tried it out with Shaders Mods, furniture mods, even installed my own .obj into Minecraft (I'm a graphic designer), but it's simply not good enough. Damn it, I've even tried an Open Source Architectural program, which is difficult to understand and to make stuff with, since you do it all in a 2D plan (although you have a 3D view of the house).

Sorry for my long rant.  Does anyone know of any alternate games there might be out there? Or what are your thoughts on this?

TL;DR: Not enough games with a good ""build your own stuff"" theme to them.",There is a HUGE gap in architectural games!
Games,"If you haven't played MGSV, I know that title sounds like hyperbole or exaggeration, but I can assure you; the single-player campaign is literally only two thirds complete. 

The game is divided into chapters, clearly marking the end of chapter 1 and the beginning of 2, there is no indication that 2 is over, the story happens as per usual and the new missions stop appearing in the mission select screen, only the final mission that reveals the plot twist suddenly appears and the game is just over without a peep. Many, many characters arcs left unresolved, and many scenes from the trailers are non-existent in the game. A movie outlining what the third chapter ""would"" have looked like is only included on a bonus disk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B4JIHh5Jqk . As a die-hard MGS fan, I was fuming with disappointment when it washed over me that no more missions and story were coming. Two thirds of a game for three thirds of the price.

By not complaining about that, by not review-bombing it, by letting it slide, we are setting the precedent that this is acceptable for games - you don't release movies that are two-thirds complete - like if the credits started rolling as soon as the iceberg hit in James Cameron's Titanic, nor do we do the same for books, albums, podcasts, artworks, etc.

Why is it only acceptable for video games and not other mediums?

edit: is there/was there, whatever.

edit: It is worth stipulating that I didn't even see any reviews mention it explicitly.",Why is there not more outrage over Metal Gear Solid V's single-player campaign being incomplete?

&gt;Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console in 2017. The game is a full remake of the 1992 Famicom title Fire Emblem Gaiden, the second entry in the Fire Emblem series. Following childhood friends Alm and Celica as they fight on opposites sides of a war between their respective nations, Fire Emblem Echoes carries over the core gameplay mechanics of the Fire Emblem series while incorporating mechanics from Gaiden and new elements including dungeons.

Games,"""We announce the final stage of the technical preparations for the Open Beta Testing of Escape from Tarkov. Thuswise, starting December 28 and over a few weeks, we'll conduct load testing of game servers in order to adjust processing for a large number of new players at the start of the OBT in the beginning of 2018.

For this purpose, we have planned a New Year event, which will give free access to the game to a part of users who are registered on the official website of the project (www.escapefromtarkov.com/registration), but are not playing yet. 7-day access to the game will be granted to a part of the players, who will be picked randomly among the total number of subscribers, with bias for those who have been registered earlier.

Within a week after the event launch, the game will be available for purchase with a 25% discount, which is effective for all types of transactions (purchases, package upgrades and gifts).

Moreover, every user who has already purchased access to the game or bought the game during the 7 days of event, is guaranteed to receive additional game gear with ability to restore it within 6 months after each profile wipe, including manual one.

Along with that, players who have joined the testing before the launch of Closed Beta (July 28, 2017), will also receive:

    Two 7-day access keys and the opportunity to share them with friends during the week.

Players who have preordered the game prior to the Alpha Test (August 5, 2016), additionally receive:

    Promo code for the Standard Edition of the game
    and two 7-day access keys and the opportunity to share them with friends during the week.

Also, we announce that forthcoming updates, which will be released before the end of the year, will include the full version of the Shoreline map, new weapons and items, as well as new features such as the new spawn and extraction system, dynamic weapon size change, helmet customization system and improved headwear slots, redesigned system of weapon mastering, dogtags and other features, which will be explained in more detail in the near future.

In the early 2018, with launch of OBT, the game will be further expanded with advanced game mechanics, and some of the existing ones will be redesigned. Moreover, players shall expect further optimization of the graphics and network components, as well as the new Interchange location and additional game content.

At this point, users purchasing any game package get access to the Beta testing and can start playing immediately after purchase.

Learn more about the project testing plans and the estimated completion time frame, and purchase the game on the official website of the project https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/preorder-page.

&gt;Cuphead is a run and gun indie video game developed and published by StudioMDHR. As the title character Cuphead, the player fights a series of bosses in order to repay a debt to the devil. The game was heavily inspired by the rubber hose style of animation used in cartoons of the 1930s, such as the work of studios Fleischer and Walt Disney Animation, seeking to emulate their subversive and surrealist qualities. Cuphead was released on Microsoft Windows and Xbox One on September 29, 2017. Praised for its art style and noted for its challenging difficulty, it sold over one million copies two weeks after release.

&gt;Tomb Raider is an action-adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. Tomb Raider is the tenth title in the Tomb Raider franchise, and operates as a reboot that reconstructs the origins of Lara Croft. Tomb Raider was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 23 January 2014 for OS X, and on 27 April 2016 for Linux.

&gt;Crystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider: Underworld in 2008. Rather than a sequel, the team decided to completely reboot the series, re-establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time, following Tomb Raider: Legend. Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai, an island from which Lara, who is untested and not yet the battle-hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series, must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult. Gameplay elements focus more on survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. It is also the first game in the series to have multiplayer and the first game to be published by Square Enix, after the latter's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009. Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010, replacing Keeley Hawes.

&gt;GC: It was interesting because it talked about the success of NieR: Automata, and yet in the same document it also talked about the rise of games as a service and the idea that single-player games were no longer as popular as they used to be. And we’ve heard a lot of similar things from other publishers recently as well. What exactly is your approach to games as a service and how do you contrast that to a game like NieR? Which is the exact opposite but has been an unexpected success. 

&gt;CEO Yosuke Matsuda: **Games as a service has a very wide meaning**, it can mean a lot of things! [laughs] Recently people have been discussing loot boxes and people not using that properly, I think that’s all linked to this bad perception people have to the words ‘games as a service’. But really, the way we’re looking at it, what it boils down to is… **that idea of keeping people engaged with our games and enjoying them for longer periods of time.** That’s the way we really look at the problem. The way we use that expression, really… the whole idea, **for a single-player game particularly, is the idea that you have the game released and you keep adding more content to keep the players engaged and enjoying the game.** And that helps to make it more of a full experience, and that brings in more players to the original game. That’s the rough approach we take to the idea, and that’s why we described games as a service in that sense.

&gt;GC: You’re right that games as a service can mean almost anything, a lot of it positive. But I think what worried people was the idea that single-player games were becoming no longer tenable, at least on a large budget. And many publishers seem to be stating that fairly unambiguously too. With Square Enix having so many great single-player-orientated franchises, can you reassure people that, as a company, you have not lost any interest in the concept? 

&gt;CEO Yosuke Matsuda: **We will definitely be making more single-player games, don’t worry about that! We will definitely be making more single-player games, definitely.** I think the environment now, that we have, there’s even more platforms, there’s even more opportunities to get single-player games out to people. So, for example, mobile phone games, we’re not just making free-to-play games for that, we’re making proper single-player games, re-releases of old titles, new titles as well. So mobile phones don’t just have to be about that kind of thing. The Switch is another great platform to come out for single-player games, so we’ve got a lot of opportunities and we really do want to continue making single-player games!

https://wccftech.com/matsuda-gaas-more-than-microtransactions/
&gt;I think a lot of the time, when people hear the phrase “games as a service”, they always focus on the problem of microtransactions – they really close out the meaning to just being that. We look at it in a much broader sense. If you look at the idea of adding things to a game after release to keep it fresh and exciting, to keep people playing over a long time, and all the different ways you can do that, it comes to express a lot more. People are too focused on the problems.

&gt;We have been thinking about it. The downside of that is that if we had one unified development platform, it would make it a lot harder to express the different characters, the different proclivities of our titles – **we make a very broad range of games, and it might affect the variation we can get in there. I think a much better way of improving the efficiency of our development that is more fitting to the way we work is, rather than unifying everything on the same platform, to take all the different approaches the individual studios use and are very familiar with, and have them exchange information about the tools and methods they use.** In that process of unification, consolidation there is obviously the trade-off in terms of individuality, and **I would rather value that than the efficiency gains to be had from consolidation.**

https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/square-enix-no-microtransactions-console-games/","Square Enix CEO: Games-As Services doesn't mean loot boxes and microtransactions to Square, Square still making single player games, no mandate for Engine Unification for developers."

**Areajugones** - Pablo Espinosa - *Spanish* - [8 / 10.0](https://areajugones.sport.es/ufc-3/analisis/)

&gt;EA Sports has delivered the most complete UFC game ever. This fighting simulator features an amazingly realistic combat gameplay and one of its few flaws is that the Career Mode is a little bit repetitive. Essential for those who love fighting games or enjoy the sport.

**Attack of the Fanboy** - William Schwartz - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/ea-sports-ufc-3-review/)

&gt;UFC 3 very well may be EA's best release in the series, but it's only by a small margin that they've improved on their previous effort.

**Cheat Code Central** - Lucas White - [4 / 5.0](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/ufc3review.html)

&gt;UFC 3 feels the most like a video game in the pool of big sports simulations. Being a one-on-one combat sim, it still feels like you're at the mercy of your own ability even though there are stats. A punch is a punch, and while some chins are more durable than others, patience and care can help you overcome the odds. It feels like a different kind of fighting game for folks interested in real-life martial arts, with a cumbersome grappling system and some branded bumbling with numbers and menus to appeal to the core audience. UFC 3 is fun and exciting, and I can see it acting as a potential entry point for its real-life counterpart.

**Digital Chumps** - Will Johnson - [8 / 10.0](http://digitalchumps.com/ufc-3/)

&gt;The start of round three is upon us! EA Sports enters the world famous Octagon once again with added replay depth and appreciable mechanic retooling.

--------------

**EGM** - Ray Carsillo - [5 / 10.0](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/ea-sports-ufc-3-review/)

&gt;EA Sports UFC 3 feels like one step forward and two steps back. Striking is more realistic than ever, but submissions and the ground game remain convoluted. The new G.O.A.T. Career mode has flashes of brilliance, but bogs you down in menus while losing the human side of fights. As well, Ultimate Team just feels like yet another cash grab. There is a decent core in UFC 3, but it needs a lot more time in the gym to become champion material.

**Forbes** - Brian Mazique - [8.4 / 10.0](https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/01/25/ea-sports-ufc-3-review-the-good-the-bad-the-bottom-line/)

&gt;With a focus on depth and functionality, the EA UFC 3 development team has created the strongest version in their series. A few minor missteps and the reluctance to embrace or include a true-sim component keeps it from GOAT status. However, there's no question it's a titleholder.

**Game Informer** - Brian Shea - [8.8 / 10.0](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/ufc_3/b/xboxone/archive/2018/01/30/ea-sports-ufc-3-game-informer-review.aspx)

&gt;With an exceptional career mode and improved gameplay on top of its predecessor's already-strong offerings, UFC 3 is the best MMA game ever released

**GamePro** - Michael Cherdchupan - *German* - [77 / 100](http://www.gamepro.de/artikel/ufc-3-twitter-beef-im-octagon,3325188.html)

&gt;Tactical martial arts simulation with an authentic atmosphere and great presentation, which has small weaknesses in balancing and ground combat.

**GameSpot** - Richard Wakeling - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ufc-3-review-in-progress/1900-6416844/)

&gt;UFC 3's overhauled striking is wince-inducingly brilliant, but its cumbersome grappling continues to lag behind.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Pramath - [8 / 10.0](https://gamingbolt.com/ea-sports-ufc-3-review)

&gt;Even beyond its merits as a faithful video game recreation of the combat sport, it's just a darn good video game that is hugely satisfying in its own right- and that, I think, is EA Sports UFC 3's greatest achievement.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Ron Burke - [85 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/winner-by-tko-ea-sports-ufc-3-review/)

&gt;EA Sports UFC 3 provides a staggering amount of improvements in nearly every area. EA Canada could have played it safe and iterated, but instead they overhauled major systems, addressing almost every complaint I had about its predecessors. Better striking mechanics, movement, and animations are joined by a fantastic career mode, and a whole host of additional attractions. I've still got a few axes to grind on submissions and AI balance, but the rest of the game is an embarrassment of riches.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Chris White - [9 / 10.0](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/ufc-3-review/)

&gt;It's about as complete an experience as it can be, and MMA fans will love what EA has done with UFC 3.

--------------

**IGN** - Mitchell Saltzman - [7.5 / 10.0](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/31/ea-sports-ufc-3-review)

&gt;EA went back to the gym with UFC 3 to work on many of the weaknesses that had the previous two games struggling to find their footing. A fantastic new striking system and a much-improved career mode lead the charge, but UFC 3 is still hamstrung by a cumbersome ground game, weird collision issues, and the straight-up terrible Ultimate Team Mode. It's still not a knockout, but Round 3 is UFC's best yet.

--------------

**IGN Spain** - Juan García - *Spanish* - [7.8 / 10.0](http://es.ign.com/ea-sports-ufc-3-xbox-one/128809/review/ufc-3-analisis-para-ps4-y-xbox-one)

&gt;Probably the best MMA game ever done, but it includes a few failures on almost every corner of the game that make this games less excellent and more so-so.

--------------

**LevelUp** - Juan Emilio Reyes - *Spanish* - [8 / 10.0](http://www.levelup.com/PlayStation-4/juegos/445767/EA-Sports-UFC-3/review)

&gt;UFC 3 is a step in the right direction for the EA Sports MMA game. Subtle but important adjustments in combat combined with a deeper career mode result in the best entry of the series.

--------------

**Player.One** - Bob Fekete - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.player.one/ufc-3-review-ps4-xbox-one-best-fighters-arent-perfect-123715)

&gt;UFC 3 is amazing to watch and fun to play, but there are still a few problems that hold it back from perfection.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Tyler Treese - [7.5 / 10.0](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/01/25/ea-sports-ufc-3-review-paper-champion-ps4/)

&gt;Besides dealing with computer-controlled submission attempts, I largely feel that EA Sports UFC 3 is the best playing mixed martial arts game to date. That's why it was so disappointing to find out that so few of the modes managed to capture my interest. Perhaps it's more of a statement on the current over-saturation of the UFC, but there's not a ton of appeal of going into the exhibition mode and seeing meaningless fights play out anymore. I need something more than that, and I don't feel like either Ultimate Team or the career mode provide it. It's in the weird position of being a game that I like playing, but one that I'm not drawn to at all. But hey, at least there's Snoop Dogg.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - John-Paul Jones - [8.5 / 10.0](https://www.psu.com/reviews/ea-sports-ufc-3-review/)

&gt;EA Sports UFC 3 is the best the series has ever looked, sounded or played and, despite a small handful of minor shortcomings, is quite simply the best UFC title to date and a very real contender for the fighting game throne in 2018.

--------------

**Polygon** - Owen Good - [7.5 / 10.0](https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/2/16965876/ea-sports-ufc-3-review)

&gt;Even with simplified grappling and submission controls carried over from the last edition, EA Sports UFC 3 is probably the least pick-up-and-play game in the sports genre. It takes real dedication, and understanding of one's fighter, to draw out the game's virtues. But they can be found in the anticlimax of a career bout that ends in a fraction of the time spent training for it. For those who can take a staggering punch and remain focused on their game plan, EA Sports UFC 3 is as close as it comes to professional fighting, without the bruises and welts.

--------------

**Press Start** - Shannon Grixti - [8 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/01/25/ufc-3-review-swingin-like-screen-door/)

&gt;UFC 3 is a rare sports sequel that probably does enough to justify its existence. The betterment of Ultimate Team and the career's focus of becoming the greatest ever help the game feel different from the last. A rich bevy of modes coupled with top notch presentation is a winning formula every time.

--------------

**Shacknews** - Bill Lavoy - [8 / 10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/103117/ea-sports-ufc-3-review-face-punching-at-its-finest)

&gt;The heart of the game is in its fighting and that's as good as it's ever been.

--------------

**Sports Gamers Online** - Michael Straw - [8.8 / 10.0](http://www.sportsgamersonline.com/ufc-3-review/)

&gt;Even with the shortcomings in the grappling and submission systems, UFC 3 has so many positives that it's hard to deny the fact that it's the best MMA game ever created.

--------------

**TrustedReviews** - Jon Denton - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ufc-3)

&gt;EA Sports UFC 3 is a fine attempt at recreating one of the most complicated sports on earth; a dynamic, exciting and often thuddingly violent fighting game that makes marked improvements to its striking game, but just like poor old Francis NGannou, still needs a lot of work on the ground.

--------------

**Use a Potion** - Daryl Leach - [9 / 10.0](http://www.useapotion.com/2018/02/ufc-3-review/)

&gt;At the start of this review I questioned whether UFC 3 was the best entry in the series so far, and without a shadow of a doubt I can say the answer is yes. Not only does the game feel more authentic than ever with its improved visuals and striking, but it also features a career mode that’s genuinely exciting and a whole host of brand new features that improve the game ten-fold.
&gt;
&gt;It still has its flaws here and there, with the ground and grappling game a little underwhelming and some aspects of the Ultimate Team mode a little uninspired (for me anyway), but this really is the best MMA game that EA have ever released and one that embraces the excitement of the sport both in and out of the octagon.
&gt;
&gt;Whether you’re a casual fan, a hardcore mixed martial arts enthusiast, or even if you just love Conor McGregor – you won’t regret giving UFC 3 a purchase.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Edward Love - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/ea-sports-ufc-3-review/)

&gt;After the disappointing UFC 2, this new entry is a significant and welcome step forward. It's not perfect, but in this form, the future's bright.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Cody Medellin - [8 / 10.0](http://worthplaying.com/article/2018/1/29/reviews/106935/)

&gt;EA Sports UFC 3 is a solid title that comes highly recommended for both die-hard UFC fans and those wanting to get into the series. Even with some fighters occupying several different weight classes, the roster count is huge, and it complements the improved striking system. The modes contain some depth and some twists that work well, while the presentation remains as good as it was before. The knocks against the submission system make it a little tougher for grapplers to deal some damage, and while the loot box system doesn't hurt the game as badly as the publisher's other titles, the additions to the economy seem extraneous. Overall, the combination of good and bad changes makes UFC3 a sideways upgrade rather than an essential one, especially if you're still deeply entrenched in the second title.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [85%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/ea-sports-ufc-3/review/)

&gt;Brimming with modes, UFC 3 is a massive game. It might only be an incremental improvement over its predecessor, but the gameplay remains stellar and the action is accessible and fun. As far as MMA games go, EA Sports UFC 3 is the G.O.A.T.

Games,"So I am by no means a Zelda expert, but I am a fan of the games. I have played and beat The Legend of Zelda (NES), OoT, Majora’s Mask, and Twilight Princess. Also played a ton of Wind Waker but never beat it. 

There are many things that I LOVE about Breath of the Wild. The art direction is amazing. I love the style that they went with and the world is beautiful. I also like the exploration aspects of the game. The fact that they made it so that you can climb up any terrain is genius, in my opinion. It’s so great to not feel limited in what you can do or where you can go. And I also really appreciate that they worked so hard to take Zelda in a new direction. This is truly a unique game and from what I understand from hardcore fans, it’s exactly what the franchise needed. 

So here’s my big complaint that keeps me from truly enjoying this otherwise awesome game.

Nothing in Breath of the Wild feels rewarding to me, at all. (Thus far.) My personal favorite part of the Zelda series is receiving awesome rewards for completing various tasks. Specifically, getting new equipment and gadgets. There is no better feeling to me than working your ass off in a dungeon, solving all the puzzles and fighting hard bosses, and then getting some SWEET new gear at the end. It feels so satisfying and I feel like my hard work paid off. That is completely replaced in Breath of the Wild for getting what essentially are “points.” 

Solved a tricky shrine in an awesome, outside the box way? Congrats! Here’s a coin. Four of those, and you get some stamina or another heart. That’s it?

 Explore every inch of the map and find some Korok seeds! To get... more inventory space. That’s it? (Admittedly the environment is beautiful enough that exploring in itself is a small reward, as well.) 

These types of upgrades are not good enough incentives for me to feel truly rewarded for my effort. I don’t feel as though I’m getting significantly stronger or more equipped as I’m progressing through the game, and as a result I’m less motivated to complete those tasks. 

I do appreciate the idea of giving you all the tools you’ll use to get through the game at the very beginning. It’s fun that puzzles can be solved multiple different ways, depending on which tool you decide to use. But if that were scaled back a tiny bit in order for me to receive more “rewards” throughout the game, that’s something that I’d enjoy even more. 

I’ll definitely finish the story in Breath of the Wild, and it’s definitely NOT bad game. I’d even say it’s a great game. But in my personal opinion, it’s not perfect, and I’m not motivated to pour hours and hours into it like I’ve heard so many others have done. I feel as though I’ll complete the story and be done with it. 

I suppose I’m just wondering if anyone feels this way as well? ","I just started Breath of the Wild (about 12 hours in) and so far, I don’t see a perfect 10/10 game. (Not hating, just trying to start a discussion... it’s a wall of text, but hear me out.)"
Games,A point and click adventure that's open world? Sounds very ambitious. It also looks like it combines some other elements as well like base building. Hopefully they'll manage to complete the game. ,StarFlint Official Trailer (English Version)

Games,"[Link](https://www.lorenzostanco.com/lab/steam/store/). I'm posting it as separate post because after reading comments in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awwajq/the_very_loose_usage_of_game_genres_on_steam_and/) it looks like very few know about its existence and I don't want it to get buried there without getting noticed.

What's so special about this service? 

&gt; **First of all, it actually lets you EXCLUDE** **tags while searching for a steam game** 

For example you like rogue-likes but you *DON'T* like turn-based mechanics. You select tag ""rogue-like"", then you select tag ""turn-based"" aand click on it so it becomes red to exclude it. You should get something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/Yd3HtCo). Now scroll down and you will see all games that meet this criteria. Don't forget to sort by ""User rating"" and use ""Wilson score"", they are a lot better than Metacritic *IMO*.

I find this feature extremely helpful because I'm not a fan of anime, so excluding tags like ""Anime"", ""Nudity"", ""Visual novel"" is a must for me when searching for a game. I'm saying this only because anime fans really rock steam reviews and their games often sit at ""Overwhelmingly positive"" on top of every game list, above Factorio, Witcher 3 or Portal 2. It's great for them but we have to admit it's not everyone's cup of tea. I also often exclude ""Pixel graphics"", ""Point and click"", ""Walking simulator"", ""Zombies"" or ""Early access"". 

But be careful excluding tags since, for example Witcher 3 tagged as ""Nudity"" on steam, you might miss some actually great game with this filtering.

&gt; **Second, It lets you exclude not popular games**

Select games with at least 100, 500 or 1000 steam reviews. [Like that](https://imgur.com/a/ApPeBQG). Visual novels with only 20 positive reviews will not be on top of ranking lists anymore.

&gt; **Third, it gives you a good overlook of any time period on steam if you select certain year** 

You don't have to select certain tags and you may leave that field empty, then sort by number of reviews to see the most popular steam games by year. [2015](https://imgur.com/a/C17zT2g), [2016](https://imgur.com/a/QeLrfPV), [2017](https://imgur.com/a/d83dbHQ), [2018](https://imgur.com/a/QhqIo2H), [2019](https://imgur.com/a/EzQ2aeI). 

According to the last screenshot apparently there's some game called Bright Memory, it was published in 2019, already has 6700+ reviews and 93% rating. It's obvious that it was meant for Chinese market and that's why no one talks about it here. But thanks to this service we can see all of these ""hidden"" gems and never miss them.

So yeah, apparently some Italian guy did Valve's job better than they themselves. 

P.S. In my opinion this site is a must for any PC gamer, as well as steamdb, HowLongToBeat, PCgamingWiki or IsThereAnyDeal. I hope you will find it useful too

Games,"I've been a fan of CCGs since the 90s and finally got into digital CCGs about 2 years ago.

The good: you can play against anyone at any time from the palm of your hand or at your desk.

The bad: Nearly every game with a decent player base is based on the mechanics of Magic: the Gathering

Why is it that so many digital CCG games are of the same genre? Physical CCGs have VASTLY different mechanics and play styles but digital ones are stuck molded after M:tG and Hearthstone.

Games,"It struck me a few days ago that, barring Xbox backwards compatibility, GTA IV has not received a proper re-release or remaster and seems to be the black sheep of the main series.

Despite being one of the best selling games of last gen, and far &amp; away the most highly rated in the franchise, Rockstar doesn’t seem to want to have anything to do with GTA IV. Rockstar didn’t even do much to celebrate its 10th anniversary at the end of last year. 

Previous GTA games have been re-released many times. GTA3, Vice City and San Andreas have all been released on PS3 and PS4, with PS3 receiving a PS2 Classic version of San Andreas and even a proper HD disc release of it as well, while Xbox 360 got first a port of the original Xbox game, then an HD version based on the mobile iteration. 

In terms of Spin-Offs, the PSP “Stories” side entries got PS2 adaptations which are still downloadable on PSN for the PS3 as PS2 Classics, and even the DS/PSP’s Chinatown Wars has been kept alive by readily available mobile versions.

And yet, except Xbox One backwards compat... GTA IV hasn’t received a proper re-release. It’s not even available on PS Now although Red Dead Redemption is. 

*It would be easy to write off that GTA IV would not a steady revenue source, but keep in mind that the much less popular L.A. Noire is single-player only and received a full remaster for not only PS4 &amp; Xbox One but even Switch!*

Certainly it’s a clunkier game 10 years on compared to GTA V or Red Dead Redemption 2 but GTA 3 is, too, in comparison to more polished latter 6th generation games like San Andreas, Manhunt 2 and Bully. 

I think Liberty City and the trio of protagonists across GTAIV and its expansions is more than worth revisiting and calling attention to, if not necessarily for gameplay strength then for what it was attempting to do narratively - and this is coming from someone who really only experienced and appreciated GTA IV secondhand through my then-girlfriend who just devoured every inch of the game world. I was way more into RDR but surely GTA IV still has its merits?",Any theories why Grand Theft Auto IV has not been remastered for current gen?

But how many people are playing other games?

One way of estimating this would be to look at other metrics. Twitch is one popular metric, but suffers from what might be called ""Spectacle syndrome"" - some games are just a lot more fun to watch people play than others. It's still an interesting approximation.

Another method might be looking at Reddit. This of course has its own flaws - ""discussion syndrome"", or ""How many people actually want to talk about this game?"" - but it is an interesting idea.

So I put it to the test.

At of 3:15 pm PST, 3/15/2019:

r/SmashBros - 4,742 browsing (all other smash reddits are an order of magnitude or more less, and have even fewer users proportionately)

---

So what can we take from this?

Well, for one thing, it's less useful than I thought it'd be; a lot of these games are multiplatform releases, which makes their Steam numbers less than reliable. Of the big three - DOTA 2, Global Offensive, and PUBG - there's not a really strong correlation between the number of users on there and the number of present users on Steam, nor the overall peak daily number of users on Steam. And PUBG is a multiplatform release to boot, making even those numbers suspect.

So, for those hoping that this would crack the nut of figuring out how many people are playing non-Steam games - I don't think it's gonna work.

But there's still some interesting things to be learned!

Apex Legends is *really popular* on Reddit - well, either that or people are really, really eager to talk about it (probably some combination of popularity and people talking about it). But Apex Legends has several times more people on Reddit talking about it than even Fortnite does, and while Fortnite is more of a known quantity, that's still *quite* substantial.

Anthem, for all that it is maligned, is still something a lot of people are interested in, marginally edging out Destiny in terms of overall number of presently active users, and only coming in a bit behind Fortnite. This is, I *have* to suspect, attributable to the fact that Fortnite has a lot of people across a lot of platforms and a lot of people who just don't use Reddit at all, as it is vanishingly unlikely that Anthem is nearly as popular as Fortnite is (unless Fortnite's popularity has seriously cratered in the last few months, as if Anthem had 100 million users I'm *pretty sure* EA would have said something by now). Destiny also still seems to be hanging on quite strongly in terms of being in the discussion still.

DOTA 2, Global Offensive, and Path of Exile all are approximately equally popular to talk about on Reddit at the moment.

Magic is a relatively popular game, though I think most people who talk about that game do so over on other websites, as there's a huge Magic community.

So while this is probably kind of useless for figuring out overall player counts, it is still interesting to look at.

The incredible popularity of Apex Legends here in particular is pretty mindblowing; it seems like that game is quite the success, and Reddit is buzzing about it.

It's also interesting that Fortnite - which is one of the most popular games in the world at the moment - is not overwhelmingly popular on Reddit, which is just further evidence that Reddit is not, in fact, the center of the gaming universe, even if people might make cracks about the weight of that little alien.",How many people are talking about various games on Reddit right now. and is this information useful?

Games,"TL/DR: Survival Games need to be more realistic and let you work towards something other then trying to be the alpha of the map, using various crafting systems that make you think.

 

I really miss the first time I loaded up a world in a game like minecraft, ARK, and Rust, etc. But as I play more and more survival games over the pass 15 years I am noticing a unfortunate trend of this genre of games almost dying, and it is simply do to fatigue in the formula. Minecraft was quite  original with the new sandbox feel, ark with the dinosaurs, and rust is just one of a kind and I can't articulate a reason but it's just different, until you realize it isn't... The games are leaning more towards main stream these games become more skimpily and with obvious game play loops that are based upon player interaction. I feel like that is the issue, every single survival game that came out in the past 5 years is about spawning in, trying to get good things and then kill everyone else or befriend them. I want a game with more realistic crafting systems, where I bang two rocks together to make a hatchet head and I have to twine the ropes using actual game-play mechanics, maybe more suited towards vr and valves new grip controllers. I want to not stop at some predefined point or just build predefined structures/tools. I want to have to think about how I'm going to combine different resources to create tools and other objects to make my in-game life easier.

&gt;Yoshi’s Crafted World is an art class plate heaped high with sugary delights that I can easily recommend.

&gt;Yoshi's Crafted World doesn't really deliver more than expected. The actual creative approaches are drowned in a monotonous soundtrack and generic story and level build ups. But at least the co-op offers enough fun for an evening with friends.

&gt;Overall, the game is best played in short bursts, and it shines when in handheld mode. But the costumes don't really add anything, and sometimes you'll come across levels that are just there to complete - they feel like filler, padding stuffed in this wooly wonder to fill it out. The innovation in paper crafts and the ingenuity in how the collectables are hidden makes you come back for more, and to see just how the next stage will surprise you.

&gt;Most of my journey through the wonderful cardboard universe of Yoshi's Crafted World, littered with myriad ridiculous noises from Yoshi, was spent with a smile on my face. It's not the type of project that's going to set the world on fire like Tropical Freeze, but it still has more heart than most studios could ever hope to give in their lifetime.

&gt;Yoshi's Crafted World may be a new game but that doesn't mean it throws its legacy away. Quite the contrary, it's a new adventure with the distinct Yoshi series' feeling, this time based on objects that can be found in every household. Thanks to its beautiful visuals, interactivity of the settings and overall heartwarming, fun and enjoyable gameplay, Yoshi's Crafted World is a game for everyone.

&gt;Following the series trademark mix of platformer and exploration, Yoshi's Crafted World delivers a pleasing experience, thanks to its both sides levels, with plenty of items to find and collect. Unfortunately, the game tries to hard to increase its lifetime by making the player go through the same levels over and over again. With stronger efforts on the soundtrack and and a better emphasis on the technical part, Yoshi's Crafted World could easily have been one of the best episodes of the series.

&gt;Yoshi's Crafted World not only change wool by cardboard to offer a charming plaform game: it goes beyond offering a ""collect-a-thon"" with a extremely varied levels, full of surprises and distinct gameplay mechanics. A very enjoyable game with local coop and a magnificent example that remind us that in 2D gaming, not all is done yet.

&gt;That layer of protection circles back to the feeling of being comforted by a blanket while rolling through the variety of cozy levels and cute touches. Yoshi's Crafted World is a stable, enjoyable adventure that brings enough of a twist to the expected Yoshi adventure to make it stand apart in a way no Yoshi platformer has done in years. It has a few blemishes along the way, but just break out the duct tape and stick that cardboard back up so you can romp your way through this delightful easy-going platformer.

&gt;Yoshi's Crafted World is simply lovely. The arts and crafts style is used in so many quirky little ways, the soundtrack lodges itself in your brain, and there's the same kind of laid back family friendly collectathon platforming that the series is now known for. Its one real new trick is its art style, sure, but that doesn't make it any less charming and wholesome.

&gt;Yoshi's Crafted World is a treat to play and is highly recommended for any Yoshi fan out there, even for the ones who skipped out the most recent entries. Believe me, this may look cute, but Crafted World may fall into being one of the most entertaining and visually appealing games that the Switch has to offer.

&gt;The visuals in Yoshi's Crafted World speak for themselves. Every corner you turn presents something new to wonder at. The game's a bit on the easy side, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you accept Yoshi titles are more about exploration and collecting than serious platforming. It's a great little ""spring game"" that should fill out your Switch library nicely.

&gt;Yoshi's Crafted World is a game utterly dripping with charm, but not that much challenge. It definitely can keep experienced and younger gamers occupied for hours, but this isn't a Switch essential. If you've got a soft spot for the green dino, then this might be worth your while. A great game for kids and younger gamers, but if you're looking for a challenging 2D adventure, this ain't it, chief.

&gt;Yoshi's unique brand of platforming is as solid as ever and comes with a brilliant visual twist, just don't expect it to bring too many new ideas to the crafting table

Games,"My statement will probably trigger a lot of people, but that's always the case with any critique. I will start by saying, Sekiro is not a bad game, but imho it's not even close to a masterpiece described by all the reviews from both media outlets and gamers. I totally know it's not souls game, so please don't try to remind me that, but it actually doesn't even matter, because most flaws apply to any genre and direction game is taking. I will focus strictly on talking what's wrong with it, to try to counter absurdly high ratings. So lets go:

**MINOR SPOILERS WARNING! (some names, mechanics mentions**

* **Combat** - it's just very repetitive. Everything is based on deflecting attacks in most cases to eventually execute deathblow - that's basically what you are doing all game and seeing exactly the same finishers. On easier enemies you spam attack until you fill posture bar - which is even worse. Occasionally you can have a leverage from using your tools, but it's way too rarely to add real sense of combat diversity. There are special attacks to unlock, but you can only have one equipped at a time? Like what? Why? That further limits combat diversity.

* **Character building** - it's basically non existent. All you have are upgrades and few special skills to unlock - basically something you'd see in older Assassin's Creed games. There is no sense of gratification for all the effort because of it, because you don't feel like you are building your character, your identity. The loot is also extremely boring - consisting of basically consumables (90% of the time) and upgrade materials - no weapons, no outfits, nothing interesting (which also makes exploring not rewarding, but only mandatory to find all of those upgrades and nothing more interesting).

* **Difficulty and boss design** - this is all over the place. I like challenge, I love DS, BB, Nioh, I play most games on highest difficulty. Sekiro with its difficulty is so all over the place. A lot of the time it feels fairly challenging and fairly brutal, but many other times it's artificial difficulty for sake of it and nothing more and a lot of BS which leads us to boss design. I think Sekiro has some examples of terrible boss design. I will mainly accent here here on 2nd stages of certain bosses with only there to piss you off and nothing more. For example - &gt;!Lady Butterfly. You ""beat"" the boss just to find out you have to do it again, only with few small extra moves - why I have to do the same stuff twice??? Then, Headless Ape which is fought fought twice, a two apes in the second fight? Such a lazy design and boss reuse.!&lt; Finally in general most boss fights are very long with multiple health bars, there are a lot of 1 shots, insane hitboxes and what not - all just for sake of piling BS difficulty and annoying the shit out of you. In DS, BB or Nioh fighting bosses is fun, it's something you anticipate and the satisfaction of beating it. Here it's something annoying and you never anticipate and after beating you're like ""finally this shit is over"". Fair challenge is not the term I'd use in this game.

* **Replay value** - actually I don't see any. Quite the opposite, there some crap I don't want to ever be experiencing again.

So yeah, I'd feel like I'd rather be playing once more either DS, BB or Nioh - which are challenging, but fairly, have character building, progression, diversity and interesting loot - which leads to high gratification for your efforts I don't see in Sekiro at all - which feels like game just to beat just for sake of beating it. To not be completely negative, I will just briefly mention positives: zone level design is phenomenal, great music score, pretty good story, lore and characters.

Now some final thoughts on the reviews. It staggers me how there is no criticism at all it nearly makes me believe most of those reviewers didn't even beat the game, or some maybe didn't even take it out of the box. They saw ""FromSoftware"" watched some trailers and wrote review out of that and glued 10/10 just like that... which means that it's as masterpiece as Bloodborne, but that can't be further from the truth. 

I honestly do believe if this exactly very same game was from different developer, people would shit on it and criticize it to hell. But FromSoftware bias is just too damn strong. I love Dark Souls and Bloodborne is probably in my top 3 games of all time - yet I don't feel obliged to praise for Sekiro like many other do, it seems.","After playing Sekiro, I feel like I'd rather be playing yet another build in DS, BB or Nioh"

Games,"It's been 4 months since Epic launched their storefront, and in that time it's been nothing if not polarizing. However, for all the articles and posts deriding or defending, there has been one major problem that has gone completely unseen. We need to talk about that problem.

Epic has a pretty serious DLC problem. As it stands there isn't a single game that has full DLC parity between Epic and Steam versions. Certainly Epic has been selling DLC, you can get the ""Gold"" editions for Metro Exodus and Borderlands 3 which promise you the DLC, but as it stands now, for games where DLC has actually released, their ""support"" is cutting it.

There are two especially egregious examples. The first is Telltale's The Walking Dead. The game is now exclusive to Epic's Store, but it is missing the ""400 Days"" DLC. Even Steam users can no longer buy it due to the deal with Epic. Epic's failure to provide proper DLC support has essentially erased that chapter from the story.  
The second is Epic's own game, Shadow Complex Remastered. Despite being an Epic game, SCR is missing it's ""Superfan DLC,"" which is the only way to buy the games soundtrack digitally. Thankfully it's still available on Steam, but it's a pretty damning indictment of the system if even the people who made it can't use it.

However those aren't the only ones. Super Meat Boy is missing it's Race Mode DLC. Slime Rancer is missing it's *free* VR Playground DLC. Vampyr is missing the Hunter's Heirlooms DLC. Thimbleweed Park is missing it's Ransome Unbleeped DLC. Half a dozen other games are missing soundtracks.


There are only two games that have DLC you can actually buy and download right now: Darksiders 3 and The Division 2. Darksiders 3 has The Crucible, but is missing the Digital Deluxe cosmetics DLC. The Division 2 has it's Year One pass with some cosmetics already availablem. Division 2 is the only game will full content parity between storefronts, and so far as I can tell that's because they're letting Uplay handle the DLC. 

(As a side note, Spellbreak has it's various versions labeled ""DLC"" for whatever, reason, but they all come with the game itself and there is no means to upgrade between the different versions.)

There is only one reasonable explanation for why so many games are missing content, which is that Epic simply does not have a system in place for handling DLC. Anything added likely has to be done manually, by Epic themselves. The fact that Darksiders 3 and Division 2 put their DLC on opposite ends of their page indicates that it's added manually, as needed, and without any sort of plan for standardization. The fact that Epic can't even provide parity with their own game indicates that adding DLC manually is not a trivial process.

The takeaway from this is clear; Epic does not care if the version you get from their store is the worst version of the game. Even with their own game they are not concerned with the idea that if you want more you'll have to rebuy the game on another platform.

This is a feature people have taken for granted to the point that no one seems to have noticed Epic went through a full quarter of a year without it. It's just assumed it was there, because launching a storefront where you can only sell inferior versions of games would be ridiculous. Yet here we are.

This is too big of a problem to ignore when we've got articles telling us that ""Epic is what PC Gamers Need"" or that it's not bad just because it isn't Steam. The issue is not that it's lacking the specialized features of Steam. The issue is it's lacking features, both major and minor, that literally everyone else supports. It's easy to say ""if the game is the same then why does it matter what store you get it from?"" but the truth is the games aren't the same. Epic is selling cut-down versions missing any possibility for expansion.",We need to talk about Epic's DLC Problem.
Games,"A long time ago. I am thinking maybe 1996. I had a PC game called Magic. It was a strategy game where you built cities and fought other computer players.

Games,"As above - interested in what people's impressions are!

For those unaware, it's an [automation-focused sandbox game, kinda like Factorio but 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLhfdULPj8A).  I played my first session yesterday in co-op with my partner - and 6 hours disappeared fairly damn quickly!

For me - I'm really liking the look and feel; the world is... *rich*, both the UI and component animations are extremely satisfying to watch, and the corporate-overlord theming is working better than I would have guessed.  

I never played Factorio, but I imagine this is hitting a lot of the same notes from a gameplay perspective - automating manual tasks and connecting everything via conveyor belts, generally creating a factory of production and exploiting the environment for the company's gain.

It's hard to describe, but this type of game satiate a part of my brain which loves a perfectly closed system, which loves seeing that last puzzle piece slot in, which loves watching a chain of dominoes fall, but couldn't bear the thought of cleaning it all up.

I was wondering if there are any examples of video game protagonists where the protagonists stood out from the crowd a bit, or were a bit unique,especially in personality.

Games,"Wanted to start a discussion on a mechanic used way too often in modern gaming. A mechanic I used to tolerate and a absolutely hate now. A mechanic that other people seem to enjoy.


I wanted to discuss this from the perspective of a player who has played WoW on and off since it released, while also enjoying completely different games that offer ""Player Progression"" in what I percieve to be a superior way.




*Grinding, Just Because*


Originally the concept of grinding and leveling in RPGs acted as a power increase vs playtime. It a cool mechanic that allowed a game developer to make difficult encounters that a good player could tackle but a less apt player could power through with more time.


For MMOs grinding was a way to space out content over longer periods of time. You couldn't see zone X until you reached level W. Since the world needs to be populated at all times, increasing how long people spend in a single area is a good way to cause populations to overlap.

*What grinding achieves*

* Give reasons for players to stick around zones for longer.
* Timegate player progression through content.
* Psychological effects of feeling stronger over time.
* Reward players for time spent.

*The Game IS the Grind vs the Grind Supports the Game*

There are some people who simply enjoy filling a bar to highlight their ""progress"". This alone is enough to keep them playing, but others like myself simply enjoy when grinding systems only if they are there to support good gameplay systems.

The difference between these two groups is that group 1 is happy doing menial tasks as long as the reward is worth it, while group 2 likes doing the things they enjoy and hope that the rewards reflect their time investment.

The problem is that, designing for group 1 is much easier than designing for group 2. You can see a lot of this in Korean MMOs, and modern WoW has a similar issue where they provide a plethora of systems you can grind in without actually making sure the the activities themselves are fun and engaging.

*Why even have levels?*

With modern MMO design, the existence of grinding levels doenst make sense. In modern World of Warcraft, when you level up for the latest expansion what actually happens is that your character gets weaker compared to the world around them. This is because of numerous scaling systems that make it so that enemies are the same level as you no matter what zone you are in (if I'm level 111 and I am fighting an enemy, I see the enemy as level 111, while a level 120 player sees a level 120 enemy). 

Combined with the fact that most MMOs focus their gameplay design on max level activities it really feels like you are forced to level up just to waste time. When was the last time you've done a quest while leveling and thought to yourself ""Wow, I cant wait to do that exact activity again!""?

This makes me ask the question of why do we even have leveling? Is it simply because that is how every expansion before did things and trying new ideas is scary? 


*Alternatives to Vertical Power Grinding*


If you really need to timegate a player before they hit endgame, could the same thing not be accomplished with forcing them to complete a set if storyline quests? Why does a leveling system need to be part of the equation?

As I've been playing Sekiro I've been thinking about how a game that people speed run in 1 hour has taken like 40 hours of my life so far, and I realized that I would much rather toss myself at a difficult dungeon/boss for 2 hours in a row than have to complete 20 mindless quests. This is primarily because I enjoyed every moment of the tense boss fights and moment to moment gameplay, which I cant say the same thing for any modern MMOs. 

Couldn't you accomplish the same form of timegating by requiring players to pass certain challenges to allow them to skip certain leveling mechanics? Keep the old grinding systems so that players who don't want to be stressed out doing difficult content, but allow them to chose the shortcut challenges?


*Horizontal Progression*

Another system I've come to enjoy a lot is Guild Wars 2. After a player reached level 80, his power level was mostly locked on place. 

Every expansion unlocked a set of transversal activities that had to be unlocked to reach and explore other areas in the expansion. This meant that players were not outclassed in power,  but simply lacked abilities to see everything right away. 

This kind of system feels much more rewarding, since there is no power level fluctuation involved, but is probably harder to design for due to the possibility of feature bloat.



*Closing Comments*

Maybe I am just getting old, but I feel like I enjoy games where my time investment isnt a prerequisite before I get to do fun things. 

Too many games these days have arbitrary systems where you have to kill enough enemies or do enough quests before you are allowed to do certain content. These systems have bled into single player games like the latest Assassin's Creed games for no reason, and all they seem to accomplish is extend play time at a minimum cost to developer.

Majority of my playtime in Games like WoW seems to be doing menial tasks so that I am at the predetermined power level before I can participate in fun content (for me, PvP like Arena), instead of doing the actual fun content.

It seems like these systems are being used more and more so the industry had decided that it is a hit with players.

Do you think it would be possible for modern large multiplayer games to ever transition out of the old ""vertical power grind"" gameplay style, or do players not want new systems in their multiplayer RPGs?

Games,"So this is actually part of a conversation I recently had with another user, and I'd like to share it because it seems like a very intriguing discussion.

Initially, it was about ""games journalism"" and ""outrage culture."" I mentioned that I do write about video games, but I'm also ""not as outraged, angered, or frustrated about video games."" The reasons are as follows:

**Background in Psychology**

It just means I find it easy to temper, control, and rationalize my emotions, or analyze how others may react.

**Games are a hobby for me**

Games are awesome, and I've been playing them since the 80s, but they're also a means of entertainment and fun. They're not something I would focus my energy on just to be angry or frustrated

**Getting old/Real-life responsibilities**

I'm nearing my 40s now, I have a family of my own, and I have so many responsibilities in life. Games are enjoyable, but gaming issues take a backseat whenever real-life priorities come into play. I also mentioned that my life experiences, social circles, and real-world activities mean that other discussions such as social service work, poverty, etc. are more important for me.

Please note that I'm from the Philippines, which is a poor country in Southeast Asia. It means the problems/issues that people face here might be different compared to those in more affluent regions. It also means that people might not view video games of utmost importance compared to real-life concerns.

----------------

Okay, enough about my life, haha.

So, anyway, the reason I'm sharing this is due to an odd fellow who chimed in that topic. The user immediately went with the ""games journalists = bad"" rhetoric, saying that he ""detests journalists"" and that ""I don't respect what video games have provided for society and culture.""

The user also added that ""I'm not as passionate about video games"" (compared to people like him), and thus ""I don't belong in the gaming industry."" Apparently, it's because I ""don't think video games will be as important as other issues.""

So I kept explaining my side to the user while also adding real-life examples. I even mentioned how much I've enjoyed playing, writing, and interacting with others when it comes to video games. I've been gaming for 35 years now, and, I was fortunate enough to start writing guides and reviews about games. I consider myself well-versed when it comes to strategy, RPG, and FPS games (quite good at 'em). I added that gaming has enriched my social life as a hobby.

Also, as a hobby, I noted how real-life issues are more important for me -- such as the fact that I would prioritize my family or social service/community engagements *before* video game issues.

But the user would have none of that because, apparently, I lacked that ""passion and respect"" for gaming.

---------------

Honestly, it was one of the strangest conversations I've ever had about video games.

Normally, people would understand why you prioritize other matters before video game frustrations, but this fella was different. It's as though I needed to hold games to the same level of importance as the ""passionate people"" do.

It was like one of those ""you're not a true gamer"" or ""you're not a real fan"" moments.

The reason why I opened this topic is to wonder whether there are people who do think like that, or maybe there are older gamers here who simply focus on more important priorities in real life before gaming issues.

The mindset was just so odd and, since I'm from a different part of the world (compared to where most Reddit gamers are from), I don't even know if that mindset is normal nowadays among users.

Anyway, just sharing. Thanks for joining in.

PS: I had that conversation while traveling for ""Bisita Iglesia"" with my family. That's a Catholic tradition here in the Philippines during Holy Week. It's time to unwind by sharing a gaming-related discussion.","Older gamers: Growing up and having more responsibilities versus ""the passion for games"""

* New game progression
 * Forget what you know about exploring Lordran. New world-changing events, key items, and unexpected pathways await you.
* New bosses and enemies
 * Triumph in new boss battles, most of which are designed to promote novel gameplay rather than sheer increased difficulty. Encounter new enemies on your journey – including enemies restored from cut content – and watch many old bosses and enemies behave in new ways.
* New NPCs and storylines
 * Meet new characters with new stories, which will intersect in numerous unpredictable ways as your journey continues.
* New weapons, items, and mechanics
 * Discover new weapons with brand new abilities, items with new effects, and sacred pacts that can change the way you play the entire game.
* Expanded lore
 * Learn more about Lordran's past from new item descriptions and gameplay events. (New content is written to build upon the lore of the original game where possible, rather than directly conflict with it, but of course, this is my own version of the Dark Souls canon.)
* New secrets
 * Don't expect to unveil all of the game's hidden content in a single play-through.

Games,"Around mid March is was shared by every media outlet that while Epic Games Store has some missing key features they have a roadmap with which they'll implement the key features through this year.

This is an important subject as many people are saying that their main painpoint with the store is that it is too barebone and it misses some really important features. For example this topic came up during the announcement of Borderlands 3 EGS exclusivity. In that case Gearbox president Randy Pitchford told that the game won't release on today's EGS but on September's EGS and according to their roadmap they will implement many key features till that date.

So I thought it's worth checking how EGS was able to keep their short term targets. So I went to their public roadmap which is available here:

https://trello.com/b/GXLc34hk/epic-games-store-roadmap

Here we can see that they actually had 6 items targeted to be released during April, namely:

- Search by Genre and Tag
- Install Management ""Under the Hood Overhaul""
- Improvements to Offline Mode
- Store Video Hosting
- Store Page Redesign
- Improved DLC Support - Multi SKU

While some of these are not precisely defined features or not targeted mainly towards end-users thus hard to estimate whether they consider it done or not what I was able to check are certainly missing. We can't search by genre, tags seemingly don't even exist, install management at least from our point of view is the same as before, preload isn't possible, etc...

If I've missed something and you can find any of these (or any other) improvements feel free to share but according to what I've seen I am afraid that since they were not able to keep even their short term plan they certainly won't be ready with the launcher Randy visioned until September...",Out of the 6 new features/improvements targeted to be released during April for Epic Games Store it seems that from end-user point of view nothing was actually released.

PvP is fun (my personal favorite) cuz you won't get matched with someone out of your league. :) MMORPGs are my favorite type of game and out of 10 or more mobile MMORPGs I've played so far, I feel this game isn't blatantly after your money (although they do tempt you at times).

Games,"Does anyone else feel this way?   


As Epic purchases more games that originated on Kickstarter, I feel less and less likely to back ANY game on Kickstarter. A page stating that there will be Steam keys seems to no longer mean that there will be, in fact, Steam keys given; the game can be moved to the Epic Game Store without a moment's notice.  


Games are supported on Kickstarter with a general understanding of what you're backing and what you're going to get by supporting the development of the game. To turn around and take a large payout (it's a company though, let's be honest. They exist to make money.) and then go against what your backers were orginally supporting seems like a slap in the face.   


These decisions aren't just detrimental to the reputations of developers, it's damaging to Kickstarter as a whole. People will be less likely to back and support new projects if they can't be confident they're eventually going to receive what they paid for.","Epic's purchase of exclusives from Kickstarter is damaging to not only the reputation of the developer, but Kickstarter as well"

Games,"[Weekend Warriors](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi2FLQDsFoGQ7RxEVMWu8iazR_mpMaCus) has a series going where Brett (experienced fighting game player) has been teaching his friend Greg (new to fighting games) how to play, with lots of focus on fundamentals. They're up to nineteen(!) videos so far, and they have great chemistry together that makes them a lot of fun to watch just for the “two friends hanging out” sort of feel. The videos are also only about half an hour each, give or take, so it's not a huge time investment or anything either.

It's been really interesting and satisfying watching a new player start to grasp fighting fundamentals like spacing and mindgames, and Brett has a great vibe to his “teacher” role that works really well (he knows how to ask pointed questions like: “why are you jumping away from your opponent, when you're playing a rushdown character who wants to be getting in close to threaten damage?”).

According to Raphael Koster's  '**A Theory of Fun for Game Design'**

He said There are two desires to achieve reward and immersion in the process of familiarizing patterns.

These two are the most powerful driving forces for users to continues playing games.

&amp;#x200B;

Proper motives(such as the reward for game items) are placed in virtual space called a raid to encourage users play together and feel fun of controlling face against to raid's pattern.

This is the most PVE's main content of the PC MMORPG since we have been watching from other MMORPG(like WOW)

Lostark is also in this area.

&amp;#x200B;

Such MMO in this area use system is 'belonged items' which mean if there isn't a system people going to try reward with the money not going to try hard raid or challenge.

A mandatory system that is belonged items to prevent people skip such contents for let them feel FUN to play a game.

But, they released raid immediate completion ticket and it is crossing the line even it is they are selling items.

With the crystal selling items from raid reward and raid immediate completion ticket is exactly same.

This is the path of P2W Lostark opened that people don't need to try main contents with their time but money.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone who made this decision in Lostark could think 'it's only 1 time for a day, it will not affect lots in-game'

But, now people simply use 1bus(korean words, 'Carry' by high lvl gears ppl) and going to use bypass ticket some times then they will lose motives.

Such like a mobile game that usually not going live long, people going to use tickets some times and then quit the game  cause realized 'what am I doing here?'

&amp;#x200B;

Lostark was most popular game in Korea at the beginning because they have lots of fun, contents with their patch direction they could make the better game but with the ticket, lots of users disappointed it is like Death sentence.

The ticket seems like to say **""Our main contents, Guardian raid is boring right? you pay we will skip for you""**

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, In-game economy will die too

Current Crystal: Gold ratio is 100 : 900

2weeks ago, when they released bundle items(cheaper price with more Arcraicums etc)

Value of Gold sharply decreased it was 100 crystal: 500G  but already 100 : 900G in 2 weeks.

They could make more various sources to people spend their gold in-game but only focused on battle items and they are more focusing on crystal selling(cash).

Just simple when it reaches at extream it will be the limit.

It's actually inevitable in game currency falling gradually but when it sharply falling the collapse of in-game economy will cause serious problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Shadows of the damned is a guilty pleasure of mine and always will be, no more heroes has also brought a big smile to my face, killer is dead was a fun (if short) insanity fest that I loved.

Good game in my opinion, except would differing choices as Paul really effect the gameplay? Or was it not drastically changed. Maybe someone who has played more than once can answer it. The only thing I don't get is, why was there no sequel? They set it up for one by hinting at Jack's new powers, and by showing Jack whispering to Beth ""I'll come back for you"".

Games,"The problem is the newer generations think a lot of stuff is toxic. I'm in my mid 20s, I grew up around consoles like N64 that required friends to be there and not online. I also played plenty of FPS on a computer and I gamed at arcades with competitive games (4 player games). Because of that I grew up around a lot of stuff that wasn't considered toxic at all. When you played 007 with 4 of your friends everyone talked shit especially if you were winning, it made it half the fun. If you're talking shit you better be able to back it up.

The same was extended into my PC days with counter strike where you would join pub servers that had regulars on there, your average Pub server served 30 people and on a good day and 100% of the server was all regulars or you had people waiting as a spectator waiting to get in. Because of that people were able to get away with ""talking shit"" and then you had to back it up. Everyone on the server was there to witness it. This also happened a lot when you joined competitive leagues. I'm not talking about ranked online, actual teams you had to sign up for and you were given teams to play. Just like rivalries in sports.

So now you have people like me who grew up ""talking shit"" and backing it up and being an actual competitor because I took competition serious. The thing was all this talking shit was just joking around with your friends and it was harmless banter. So now you have these new people being introduced to a game I'm playing and they think this harmless banter is me being toxic but the reality is, I'm just having fun and talking shit to make the game more competitive. So most of the people that call toxic behaviors are just people that are new and aren't aware of what banter is.

This can be commonly found among twitch streamers too, they will have friendly banter between 2 very popular streams and a lot of viewers assume they are actually fighting or being toxic when its just friendly banter.

It's not going to get any better, more and more people are being shielded and coddled. Look at those trigger warnings, safe spaces and micro aggression that exist today. This wasn't a thing 10 years ago.

Games,"I'm wondering if people are starting to play more singleplayer games than multiplayer games.

In recent years after the introduction and streamlining of lootboxes to become the new norm the developers and publishers are trying to push the envelope further and further every year. New multiplayer games coming out have a decent amount of content at release but you can see where they were cutting some corners. It is not the full experience you were getting 5-10 years ago, because they are trying to go the live-service route which gates you the content what should've been in the game initially.

Battlefield V had skins leaked which were not supposed to be in the game and were to be released 3-4 months down the road yet those skins even though they said were ""not quite ready yet"" looked quite polished and done. They are basically holding back content for the game with the intent of releasing them later so they have stuff for their live service programs.

The second problem I see is the amount of increasing microtransactions, which in some cases could be renamed macrotransaction because the price they are asking for the items are quite high. Most of these items are not even worth getting because the titles that are agressively pushing these transactions have a shelf life of 1 year at best. It's literally throwing money out of the window because in a year those items wouldn't be imported into the new iteration of said titles, and noone would be playing those games anymore because the playerbase would shift to the most recent member of the family. So with that in our mind, what are the actual incentives for us to get those items? To stand out in the lobby and server? To enjoy the exclusivity and feel like a superior player who invests into the game? Do we really have to get the game for 60€, and then spend another 240€ in the span of one year to get third of the available stuff which in better cases are holding only cosmetics and not pay to win luxury items?

My first experience with the declining quality of game was with Dota 2. It is a free to play game in which I had spent a lot of hours enjoying the content and the gameplay. After a few years I was getting hyped for The International 3 and I had decided I was going to get the Compendium which had an insane value of goods for a low price. (Why? Because I had spent a lot of my free time in the game, and I thought I was obliged to return the favour by purchasing something they were offering.) No other sheninigans. You would get cooler items collectively for free when the prize pool had reached a certain number. You couldn't buy more items, you knew what you were getting at the start. Yet two years later Valve started to push it further and further with the introduction of leveling said Compendium, and later renaming them into Battle Passes. After they had restructured the competitive scene of the game with Major and Minor tournament systems, they have introduced Battle Passes for seasons inbetween The Internationals. The first I bought, it only had 60 levels, and you could get all those levels just by playing. The second however had a higher achievable level which you couldn't get just by playing. You actually had to buy levels if you wanted to get everything available in those Battle Passes. I told myself that was too much. I decided I was going to wait and see if the next International in line would have the same system, and as it turned out, it would. After 4100 hours and 5 years I just uninstalled the game and haven't touched it in almost two years. I still watch the tournaments on Twitch but I refuse to support such practices. I like to not think of myself as a cash-cow.

That is why I started to get into singleplayer games more and more. Games I can get for 60€, and I get everything. The full experience. Yes, there are DLCs which I don't really care for because 10 out of 9 times I don't get those because I had either beat the game already and I uninstalled it and I'm not waiting 5-6 months for a 2 hour story extension, or I'm just not interested in those at all. Yes, there are some singleplayer games which are trying to push to lootboxes down our throats (Shadow of War comes to mind), but it is not impossible to beat the game without them. I also like the fact, that those games are not treating me as a sack of golden honeypot. But, unfortunately you can also see the shifting mindset in singleplayer games as well. Ubisoft recently is trying to incorporate the live service system into every single game of theirs. For the most part it is only a glorified collective name for the cut-up DLC stuff, so it seems like we are getting something every few weeks. However I do wonder if they will try and push it a bit further later in the new year, since they have introduced their new Uplay+ Game Pass service which according to them will get you every available DLC for the game which are featured in the Pass.

However these games take a long time to finish. Andromeda, Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, Witcher 3 both took me 120-160 hours to finish. Metro Exodus, We Happy Few and other AA titles also take up to 50 hours to fully experience. Given that I have less free time I can enjoy these games for months. With multiplayer games implementing live services, I would have to play a few hours at least every day, because of the fear of missing out. The items you won't get in the current Season Pass or Operations would be lost, and the only way to get them would be through lootboxes or by paying for them. Yes, I was stressing out more just by seeing the timer going down and down, and thinking I wouldn't get that sweet item and the end of the line. Absolutely nuts.

My feelings overall are conflicted. I do love gaming, however given that I'm not wealthy, and I'm not earning that much in Central Europe, I don't like the fact, that the publishers and developers expect me to pay more and more just go keep up with my teammates and enemies in multiplayer games, so we don't have monetary advantages in a match over each other. I also don't like the fact, that most of these titles are active only for a year, before the community discard these games. Battlefield and Battlefront games and some other niche multiplayer games like PUBG, Overwatch, Arma have a longer shelf life because the development cycles are longer, and that is something I actually care about more and more when deciding which multiplayer game to get next. EA saying that singleplayer games are not selling are mostly because they can't actually implements these ""surprise mechanics"" into them. Once they figure out how they can do that with getting away with them is the day other singleplayer games will try the same, and I will actually have to look for an other media to relax and enjoy.

Do you also feel the same pressure with having to get every single item in these Season Passes? Do you also feel like you are a wallet to these developers and publishers and not a human being with other resposiblites in life? Are you also playing more and more singleplayer games because they are not predatory as multiplayer games?

A simple tutorial showcases a teleport glitch, how to do it, &amp; some simple puzzle ideas.

\-------------

Not everyone uses glitches to make bad levels/troll levels in Super Mario Maker 2. Some of these glitched levels are awesome. I wish there was a glitch tag that you could set to your level. This tag would stop it from showing up in endless Mario, so when someone plays a glitch level, it's because they want to play a glitched level.

I love glitches, if I can't make perma levels, then at least I can make glitched offline levels and turn it into a video!",Teleport Glitch Tutorial - Super Mario Maker 2/Tis a Shame when Nintendo deletes good levels

Games,"I have enough. So many things seemed new about this game - setting, approach to a main character, line hook, dying twice, poise based combat system etc. But seriously it's more of the same Souls at the core. Maybe I am getting old and have no more headspace for such games, but I feel like I was doing the same thing when playing DS, DS 2, DS 3 and Bloodborne. **Same thing for 7 years straight.** For what? For that thrill of overcoming myslef? I have done that with those previous games already. 

Been there to play Dark Souls at release (so good back then), then the rest of the trilogy with Bloodorne (materpiece) in the mix. Played Soulslike like Nioh or in some manner God of War, played those offsprings like Hollow knight or Dead cells and I feel like even tho some elements differ one from another the experience stays the same. And it's so tiring at this point in 2019. I hear about those new games - Elden Ring, Code Vein or The Surge 2 - and all I can think of is 'I am done, have no time for this, not interested at slightest'. Don't get me wrong - those game are separately very good, have fair pricing (no gaas shit) and work very well.

Games,"Nintendo launched their new mobile game Dr. Mario World today on iOS (maybe Android, I'm not sure). As far as I'm aware, this is the first time the doctor has been seen outside of Smash Bros. since the original NES title. The gameplay is similar to the original Dr. Mario for the Famicom, but with your standard free to play mobile flair, taken straight from the school of Candy Crush. There are various characters that can be acquired through a gacha mechanic, each with a unique power that can be used. There are three main currencies in the game: gold, hearts which are used to play levels, and diamonds, the premium currency. Every time you play a level, you lose a heart. In typical mobile fashion, you gain hearts over time or can request them via a clan system. 

The alternative is to buy hearts, which can only be bought with diamonds. These hearts will run you [10 diamonds for 5 hearts, or 30 diamonds for 60 minutes of uninterrupted play, i.e infinite hearts.](https://i.imgur.com/7LSB3rC.jpg) However, the cost of the hearts is extortionate, even for mobile games. As usual, you can't buy the exact amount, either slightly below 30, buying 20 diamonds, or slightly more than, buying 50. These diamonds average out at around £0.10 per diamond, meaning if you wanted to buy the cheapest option of 20 diamonds, it costs £1.99, equating to £4, or 5 USD to be able to play the game for 60 minutes. 

I think this is insanely priced, and I think it's a shame Super Mario Run didn't have good sales, and FE Mobile being a cash cow which has ultimately run to Nintendo having this business model for their mobile games. It leaves me slightly worried for the Mario Kart game coming out, and how steeply Ninty will charge for maps and characters. Do you think this model will work for Nintendo?

Games,"Lately there has been a lot of drama around G2A. I don't want to reiterate the whole story, but just give you some basic points. 

G2A was called out by an indie developer, that he rather wants people to pirate the game than buy keys from them. In later steps he details, that the matter of stolen keys was never cleared up by G2A. This lead to very weak attempts of G2A to get their image right and even a case, where they tried to bribe some to plant false information. 

This whole affair was accompanied by a lot of outrage here on reddit and by influential people in the games industry, like Jim Sterling.

I don't want to defend G2A and I am not affiliated with them in any way, but I have the feeling that we need to look into this a bit deeper and have a look at the system, powering the fraud.

**Credit Cards:**

From what I have gather **all of the** fraud **cases**, where keys were stolen and then sold on G2A, were **payed with credit cards**. Credit cards are, and always have been, a bad payment method from a security stand point. Just get the number and the date of expiry (maybe also the  Card Validation Code) and you can pay with this information.

Instead of attacking the middle man in G2A, who I do not sympathize with, go for the source of insecure online payments: Credit Cards.

**They should up their security by making some from of two factor authentication mandatory. Otherwise they simply should not be accepted as valid payment for game keys in order to stop fraud.**",G2A drama - credit cards

Recently I have encountered a very annoying problem that has affected me when playing MMOs like TERA, Soulworker and even a shooter game Star Wars Battlefront II (the EA one).

I live in Latvia and we have one of the fastest internet speeds here in the world and my internet is FAST but when I play certain MMOs, after about half an hour I get disconnected from the server and I have to log-in back which is extremely annoying as I lose progress and have to start over doing certain things. 

This problem doesn't affect me in other games like CS:GO, GTA5 or TF:2, maybe because they don't kick you out if you have a small internet loss, you just get lagged for a bit and then you connect back...? I'm actually not sure if I'm losing connection or it's something else as I have strong internet. 

''Server disconnected. Check your Internet connection if the problem persists.''

''Failed to connect to the EA Servers. Online features will be unavailable. Please check your internet connection and try again.''

But the most interesting thing is after I get disconnected I can always instantly connect back, like I can log-in to my character instantly.... so it shouldn't be an Internet problem? I don't know really.

Games,"I gave this a lot of thought, and with my niece and nephews all consumed with eSports, it made me wonder: will real sports enthusiasts eventually be less than their eSports counterparts? I think so. What're your thoughts?   


To me, the greatest asset that eSports has is the fact that they add the additional dimension of Problem Solving, that real sports just can't really mimic. Real life is limited. In games, you can keep throwing crazy and complicated problems at pros to solve, and the more complicated, the better it is to watch. The better a sport is to watch, the more successful it becomes.  


As an example, I mean like DotA's drafting phase. Imagine you had that kind of dynamic in real sport- someone picks a dude who can throw boulders at your quarterback.  


I made a video discussing the concept in more detail, as it's difficult to not write an essay here on reddit. I don't want you to just check out the video, I am legitimately curious for your thoughts, so please put em down below!

Games,"Greetings, r/Games!

We are EXOR Studios, and indie game company based in Szczecin, Poland. We started out as a modding group, creating total conversions of our favorite titles. Our first major release was [D.I.P.R.I.P.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17530/DIPRIP_Warm_Up/), a multiplayer vehicular combat mod for Half-Life 2. After that release, we moved on to standalone projects based on our own technology.

In 2009 we made [Zombie Driver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220820/Zombie_Driver_HD/), one of the first indie games to be published on Steam. It used the earliest version of what would later become our custom, C++ based engine, The Schmetterling. The alternatives at that time were either very expensive, or not good enough for us to use. Creating our own tech was the only viable solution.

After the success of Zombie Driver we moved on to work on our next project, [X-Morph: Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/408410/XMorph_Defense/). The development of this game took more than 5 years. While we were working on this one, the revolution in the game engine world happened. Some engines became free to use, others got much better than they were previously. However, we were too deep into the project to change the engine at that point, so we decided to keep working on it. Here's a [showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XULqtPtX28A) of what we managed to accomplish.

Currently we are working on our next title, [The Riftbreaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/780310/The_Riftbreaker/). It utilizes the latest version of the engine, The Schmetterling 2.0. We have upgraded it with PBR renderer an tons of other new features, such as fully [dynamic vegetation](https://youtu.be/F4tbyhkHAOg). 

What is it like to work with your own engine? Why do we keep doing this? Should you start working on yours now? Or perhaps you would like to know about some other aspects of indie dev life?

I can't be the only one constantly meeting these cheaters, it's honestly every other game and that's just the player i die too.I really don't get why SIX MONTHS after release they haven't mentioned cheating on console (their biggest playerbase) ONCE!","Apex console players, why are we 6 months in and the rampant cheating still hasn't been addressed once and cant even be spoken about in any Apex subreddit and reports get ignored on the EA website."
Games,"And there is a difference between constructive criticism and outright hating on a game because that's what people do.

Obviously not all games are successful and not all games are what people want, but there are always people that enjoy those games,

Whenever a new game comes out it judged based in previous games of the same franchise or even the developers previous games, sometimes even things that have to do with the pr that has nothing to do with the quality of the game.

But the point is games are always judged based on what they have that are bad. Or what they don't have that is good. Example, Fallout 76 came out, despite the bugs that were gone by time I got my hand on it, about a month after month release, everyone rated it as a single player rpg not the MMO that it is. Same thing happened with elder scrolls online.

Whenever a game has microtransactions no matter how insignificant people well not like the game, example, Wolfenstein Youngblood, didn't even know they were there until I saw complaining online.

Although considering the games I have mentioned this is a good time to mention that the community is extremely toxic towards Bethesda, 1-the Bethesda people ""hate"" is Bethesda game studios, that's the one part of it that Todd Howard controls, but if anyone game is PUBLISHED by Bethesda SOFTWORKS it gets flak. 

Point is, we as a community should start making our opinions on games based in the game and nothing else, sure, some friendly judging when something may be missing or was left out, or if there is a feature that is frustrating, but every game should be rated and judged as its own entity. Not as a part of the big picture of its franchise, (Wich the only time it's valid to not like a game because it's different from its precursors is when story is messed up) or judged because of other product made by the same company.

K, now you can downvote me.

Last note: this is more than just Bethesda, so many games come out and get ripped apart because they are not what came before. You guys just seem to hate inavation.","Why is the gaming community the most toxic towards games, like honestly, I can't remember the last time a game came out that was considered ""good"""

Games,"Tjeres something ive never quite understood about the way people perceive how reviews for games and their respective associated number scores work. Ill use an example, state of decay 2. This game is classed as having mixed reviews, with a 66 metacritic score. Now, as far as im concerned anything above 5 should be considered above average, by no means a ""bad"" game. But i remember when SoD2 came out, or any game that gets less than like 80 on metacritic, everyone kicked up a huge stink as if it was a bad game. Same goes for the recent ps4 title ""days gone, which scored a 71.  

Seriously. since when is a 7/10 average ""mixed"" reviews? 7 out of 10 to me is a good solid game, not amazing, not perfect, but a damn good time. When did below 8 become bad? seriously? People care way too much about scores and numbers as it is, and i can understand wanting to know the quality of a product before you drop your hard earned cash on it, but a 71 metacritic should not spell the death of a game just because it was expected to get 0.9 higher scores. It frustrates me to see games that are good impacted so heavily because they arent at like 90 metascore. Obviously people expected a little more from days gone, but ive played the game and its damn fun. Word of mouth should be the real factor that determines how good a game does... does anybody agree? 

I guess what im trying to say overall is that i hope people can see a score of 7 out of 10 and still think the game is worth their time. Marvels spiderman  released with below 90, (85 or 86 i believe) and i guess people expected more? 86 is a score that is instant purchase or for me. i will play a 6 out of 10 game if it interests me enough, maybe even a 5 if its something im a huge fan of and if it is at a reduced price.

Some production groups are internal and others external. In external production groups, I'll put the developers in each of the games to show which company they worked on for production. With that said, let's go.

-

The core development force of Nintendo, with multiple production groups scattered across their main R&amp;D plants in Kyoto and Tokyo. The personnel totals around 800 game developers that range from fresh recruits, to industry pioneers who worked on the original Famicom. While the internal R&amp;D groups mainly focus on developing Nintendo's biggest franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros. Animal Crossing, Splatoon, and Mario Kart - there is also a significant chunk of resources exclusively dedicated to creating new IPs or experiences like Miitopia, Nintendo Labo, 1-2 Switch, and Miitomo.

And that's all of it. There's much more that could be put out with the quantity of development companies that Nintendo works or worked but I tried to focus on the more frequent ones. Again, the link with most of the credits is on the original post.

Throughout the game I experienced frame rate dips, freezing for several seconds during certain conditions, inability for the map to load, long load times, and during particularly chaotic fights much larger FPS dips that would last through much of the combat. The FPS hits were mostly managable for a lot of the game but with all the powers unlocked in larger fights and being aggressive it'd be sustained drops (what felt like in the 15-20fps range) for a long portion of the combat. 

This was on a Pro so I can't even image how bad it is on a base console. This feels like it needed to be delayed since releasing in the state it has feels exceptionally bad.",Control might be the worst performing game I've played this generation to date.
Games," Hello r/Games!

We are the publishers of the recently announced cyberpunk game—[Ghostrunne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1139900/Ghostrunner/)r—and we’re here with the developers from One More Level (creators of God’s Trigger).

If you’re not yet familiar with Ghostrunner, it’s a fast-paced action game with *one-hit-one-kill* mechanic. It takes place in a dark futuristic world torn by an apocalypse that has forced the last remnants of humanity to live in a mysterious tower-city. The [gamescom demo gameplay](https://youtu.be/_Fwmb5kvkOs) says it all.

We’ll be answering your questions this Friday (**September 6**) from **1:00pm to 2:00pm UTC**, but you can already start posting questions to give us a head start. We’ll do our best to answer as many of them as possible.

Would you like to know what the inspirations behind the game are? How often do we die in the game on average? What does cooperation between devs and publishers look like? Feel free to ask these and other Voight-Kampff test questions.","AMA: We’re the publishers and developers of Ghostrunner, a game widely recognized as one of the biggest surprises at gamescom, even though it almost didn’t make it to the event. We’re here to share stories and answer your questions!"

Games,"The ingame on Borderlands 2 menu on xbox says the newest DLC for Borderlands 2 is free, I clicked the option to download it and came to Microsoft store where the DLC was and I it says I have to pay money to download it.   
   
This was apparently a part of a campaign that ended on July 8th, and Gearbox and 2k failed to update the menu to reflect the fact that it's no longer free.   
   
I've been in contact with xbox support who referred me to 2k support, 2k support. I explained my case and said that since they are advertising it for free that'd I'd appreciate if they could help me out.   
Fat chance, no dice. They referred to an article about the campaign ending on July 8.   
    
When you advertise something for free in your own game and it really isn't, and fail to rectify the issue when it's addressed, that is how you lose a customer.   
    
Due to poor customer support I will not be purchasing Borderlands 3 and any more DLC. It's sad it had to come to this for such a great game.",Why 2k support sucks and I won't be buying Borderlands 3.
Games,"Hi. I want to talk about our vocabulary as people who play, develop, and talk about games.
We all know about the terms “first party” and “third party” when it comes to the industry, hell you’re subscribed to r/games, good shit bro. But I’ve seen people refer to some games as “2nd party” and that where my record scratch comes in. Let’s visit what those terms means.

We’ll start with the usual ones: first party is simple, it’s the seller of the console who made the game. Third party is also simple, it’s whoever isnt selling a console that made the game.

Now if you’re telling yourself that it sounds like that’s the end of it... well... you’re right. That is it. “What’s 2nd party then?” Well, this might be awkward but, it’s YOU! Yeah you, the person who bought the console!

It makes sense when you think about what third party really means, because the second party (you) are intrinsically connected to the first party (console seller) and now another party that is independant to that relationship can still make games for you. And if you were counting, yep that’s a third party.

Now I understand that as the vocabulary goes, when we talk about those weird independant developers making exclusive games, it’s easy to go “well, 1st party is directly connected to the console seller, and 3rd party isn’t so we’ll split right down the middle at 2nd” but I don’t think that it illustrates the right relationship between everything involved.

Take Spider-Man last year, Insomniac isn’t a first party developer for the Sony, yet they made an exclusive. In my mind, that’s a third party exclusive.

So yeah, that’s it really. Please discuss how you had never thought about it like that, or how I should probably die in a fire for being so stupid, either way doesn’t matter.","1st party, 2nd party, 3rd party: A Clarification"

theres only 7 versus maps in the launch and the first drop of post launch content comes in december. thats way too few maps. theres 4 maps from gears 4 but they can only be played in private matches. why is that? they should add the gears 4 maps in the public playlists immediately or the game is gonna get old FAST.

Games,"Years ago I was reading the review for Thief: Deadly Shadows on the Official Xbox Magazine and one of the side comments was that Hardcore Gamers who play on Hardest Difficulty can expect to spend hours on a single map as they collect loot and avoid detection by guards.

Games,"Inspired by /u/MayorOfBridgewater and /u/Intelligent_Genitals 's Further Reading posts, I figured I'd do one for the Tropico series.  If you like dictators and the Cold War in the Caribbean, you might enjoy the below books.

*Red Heat: Conspiracy, Murder, and the Cold War in the Caribbean* by Alex von Tunzelmann - Focuses on Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, so if you want to learn more about Batista, Castro, Papa Doc, or Trujillo, this is a great place to start.  One of my favorite books on the topic.

*How to Be a Dictator: An Irreverent Guide* by Mikal Hem - A humorous look at various dictators, while purporting to offer advice on how to be successful.  Sort of an Evil Overlord List, but for brutal dictators.

*The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior Is Almost Always Good Politics* by Johnny Heller and Bruce Bueno - A more serious sociological look at dictators' actions using the lens of rational choice to explain why democratic leaders act differently from autocratic leaders, be they political, corporate, or other.  The gist is that in democratic regimes, you need the support of millions of voters, so the best way to ""reward"" them is to spend tax revenue on public improvements, but when you only need the support of a few people, like generals and oligarchs, they're few enough in number that they benefit more from just direct bribes.

*Modern Tyrants* by Daniel Chirot - A concise history of various 20th century tyrants, from Argentina to Iraq and beyond.  I enjoyed this book a lot, and it's probably the most informative of the bunch if you just want to know about various dictators and their actions.

And lastly, two BBC programs.  [Dictators on the Couch](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08tbbmt) about psychologically profiling dictators, and [The Dictator's Survival Guide](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09sn5f8) about how they stay in office.",The Tropico Series - Further Reading

You've given a ""girl gamer"" attention before, so of course they're gonna do it again to get your attention again.

It's probably the worst-case scenario of how one of these services can be implemented, and I didn't want it to fly under the radar as this is something subscription services should rightfully be raked over the coals for.

A day or two ago, a company called [Bending Spoons Apps IVS](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/bending-spoons-apps-ivs/id1280299077) suddenly became the publisher for a bunch of paid games on the app store. They manage a game subscription service called Playond, which has its own app.

At the same time, they've pulled the (paid) games they acquired from the store, updated and reposted them under their own brand, as free-to-download games gated behind an in-app purchase subscription fee. This includes quite a few genuinely decent games like Wonder Blade, Crashlands, Fowlst, and others listed here: https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/bending-spoons-apps-ivs/id1280299077#see-all/i-phonei-pad-apps

The result of this pull-and-update is that licenses held by customers were effectively voided, and the only way to access these games now is by subscribing to Playond, whether you owned them before or not.

There are two parties that allowed this to happen:

1) Playond, for getting the rights and revoking the existing games.

2) Apple, for allowing Bending Spoons to do this on their storefront.

Obviously this isn't a call-to-action or anything. But this should serve as a huge warning to anyone spending money on Apple's store. They're perfectly fine with a publisher revoking digital rights. And on top of that, this is a big warning against any company pursuing a subscription model.","A mobile game subscription service called ""Playond"" has just revoked existing customer licenses for several games and put them behind a sub fee"

I've been working on this series since the beginning of 2019! These videos have been a blast to create and I wanted to share my content with everyone here! also what are some of your favorite action games?",I've been working on a full retrospective on every single platinum game ever made!
Games,"I got PS4 Dreams around mid June using only the duel shock controller and so far my experience with it has been fairly positive . As a creation platform, PS4 dreams is by far the most user friendly and flexible game creation tool that I have ever worked with.That said, rarely will I find creations that will hold my interest for more than 30mins.Dreams as of right now is a product that you must invest yourself in to really get its full value and that may not be what most people are looking for.So far the user experience can be divided into two parts, the creator  aspect and the consumer side of things.  From a consumer standpoint, dreams still hasn't had enough time to build a good library of interesting titles outside of the ones that Media Molecule has already created, but there are definitely a few notable games that I have played.The creation tools on the other hand, now that's where the good stuff is.

 Dreams is what I always dreamed of having as a kid. I remember asking my parents when I was young for the game creation programs only to be disappointed to find out it was mostly just copy and pasting per-made assets. Even just using the Duel Shock controller, the creation workflow for dreams felt very intuitive to me and I found my self creating beautiful set pieces after just an hour or two of fiddling with the modeling and painting tools. Dreams is definitely a powerful tool when it comes to creating game worlds and music, but how does it fare in what its main focus is, making games?

 Dreams uses a sort of visual programming logic, and it comes with a lot of tools too. There are logic gates, collision boxes, global variables, movers, triggers, almost everything you would need to manipulate you levels and characters to create the game you've always dreamed of...almost. As of right now dreams is very good at creating platformers, narrative focused adventure games,and small scale action games, but games that require to save a lot information about the state of the world or the player are very hard to create in Dreams.The artist is limited to only a few Global variables that can be carried from scene to scene. This means that games that require extensive databases (primarily RPGs), the artists is going to be very limited to how much data he can bring from scene to scene, such as player health, level, items, money, ect. There are a few ways around this, people have ways to fit it a bit more memory by using binary encoding, but even that has its limits and it can be hard to keep track of.

Another Problem is the tagging system is very finicky. The problem i encountered is that tags are not actually applied to the collision box of the model it is actually attached to, the tag can only be activated from the actual tag component. This to me makes zero sense and I'm still not quite sure why it is this way. 

**TL;DR**

Dreams so far is a fantastic tool to create the game you always envisioned with a few limitations. If you've ever been interested in creating music, art, or games, dreams is a MUST HAVE. If you're only interested in the games that people have created, I would say wait until the full release.",PS4 Dreams Has Been Out For Early Access For Almost 5 Months.

Games,"I was as shocked as most people to see the ""gambling-casino-trailer"" when it first launched on YouTube. After watching several reaction videos, I was really angry and frustrated and joined in on sending tweets and e-mails to 2K and PEGI. This was September 10. Today I finally heard back from PEGI via e-mail. I was hoping for a response in the direction of that they are still evaluating it, or that they still had an ""internal discussion"" on the topic. That would at least put my mind a bit to ease, and I could still have the hope that they would change the rating of the game. But how wrong was I:

&gt;PEGI Info [~~info@pegi.info~~](mailto:info@pegi.info)  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for contacting us regarding the PEGI rating for NBA 2K20.  
&gt;  
&gt;We apologize for not replying immediately but we felt it was important to wait for the actual release of the game to clarify how we perform the examination of a video game.We have received many questions and complaints following the trailer about the MyTeam section of NBA 2K20. The trailer focused on that specific part of the game and had a prominent role for chance-based mechanics, including some that can be found in casinos today. Our examination however is not based on marketing materials, but always on the actual game which is provided to us prior to release in order to review all the content that may impact the age rating.  
&gt;  
&gt;The game that is available to consumers today does not contain simulation or images of gambling as it can be played in casinos. There are some mechanics to randomly appoint opponents or rewards for winning a game (without wagering money or making bets), but they do not resemble casino products. These differences mean there was no reason to change the rating of the game.  
&gt;  
&gt;We take note of the discomfort and concern that people are expressing with mechanics or aesthetics in games that bear resemblances to gambling. As a rating organization, we continuously review how and whether new developments should be reflected in our classification criteria, but it is important to maintain an objective and fact-based classification system. We will properly assess how the rating system, and the video games industry in general, should address these concerns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kind regards,

The first paragraph was something I was expecting to get from them. This is the answer I have seen around the Internet before. So this was nothing new. But the 2nd paragraph was the one that actually shocked me. (Even though I probably shouldn't be too shocked.)

PEGI are claiming that

*""The game that is available to consumers today does not contain simulation or images of gambling as it can be played in a casino.""*

Are they really saying that there are no slot-machines, pachinko-machines and wheels of fortune in casinos? I really beg to differ. Also they are claiming that the ""mechanics"" are without wagering money or making bets, and therefore this is not simulated gambling or image of gambling? This feels to me as if they are trying to get out of this on a technicality. A technicality I don't really see. If something is simulating gambling or is an image of gambling, as I strongly believe this is, it should clearly be rated as a PEGI 12. As by their own definition of what a PEGI 12 rating is: 

 

&gt;PEGI 12  
&gt;  
&gt;Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild. **Gambling as it is normally carried out in real life in casinos or gambling halls can also be present (e.g. card games that in real life would be played for money)**

This answer has made me change my opinion on PEGI, even more than their first statements after the NBA 2K20 MyTeam trailer. 

I have been holding seminars on video games in my local schools to help parents understand video games, and give them tools for how to decide what video games they want their kids to play. One of these advice has always been to look for the PEGI rating and the warning labels on the back of games. Well, this clearly has to change, as my trust in PEGI just hit rock bottom",Finally heard back from PEGI regarding NBA 2K20 rating after waiting nearly a week

Games,"My family and I are trying to track down a PC game we all vaguely remember from the late 90's, early 2000s. I remember the cartoon style so clearly; 2d, flat colors, simple details, but vibrant. It was a point and click adventure, reminiscent of Sierra or Lucas Arts games, in it's attention to detail and weird, environment based solutions to problems.  I'd know it if I see it, and I'm sure someone remembers it, so please cross post anywhere. 

Game Style: Point and click adventure.  
Developer / Publisher: \[Unknown\]  
Release date: (early 2000's is our best guess)  
Origin: Possibly downloaded off of the internet

The setting is a bit like being trapped in a computer world. The player has to gather everything possible in his inventory, and use it in unique, unusual ways. It reminds me of Curse of Monkey Island in it's complexity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your room has a bar code looking carpet.The whole room was mostly black and white.   
Blue goo held up wires for a sound system in your room. (later used for a puzzle involving a guy blocking your bedroom door). The player character, an average looking white guy with blonde or red hair, starts out in a bedroom, and there is a storm. (My brother named it Storm Go Away) After the storm, you're trapped in the bedroom, and you can't get out the door or windows. You have to get blue goo/sticky tack off one of the posters in your room and store it in your inventory.   


There was a concert at the beginning that, when played backwards, sounded like jingle bells.

Your cursor was red, and sometimes context sensitive.  
Environment interaction was like a usual point and click adventure game; involved clicking text at the bottom left of the screen to talk to people, and using items you have collected (from an inventory screen), and possibly other context sensitive cursor interactions. (similar to secret of monkey island and other Lucas arts games)

Beyond your bedroom door, was an area that led to an elevator, and someone else's room, with panels on the walls of the hallways with alien handprints on them. At one point, you find a very smooth glove, and meet a woman who had every wrinkle of her body surgically removed, this glove is used to fake the hand scanner and get into her room. (There's a Narnia joke in here when you go through her closet)   


There was a puzzle that involved teleporters, and one of them was in a dingy bathroom.  
There was a puzzle that involved you getting trapped in a flashing rainbow tiled wall, and you played as a white orb that tried to free you from it.   
The main character may have had a girlfriend.  
There was a doctor's office puzzle that you had to get an item from (possibly by faking an illness).  
The world was inhabited by aliens / monsters.  
Dialogue text was multicolored, but mainly yellow.  
The game was likely sci-fi themed.  
Time travel is likely involved at one point. 

&amp;#x200B;

The end of the game concluded in the fact that it may have been all a dream. I remember the end scene, the player arrives in his front yard, thinking he has escaped, but all the game characters, in particular a frog, are still there, haunting your life.  I don't know if there are other endings.  

Any hints or clues would be appreciated in solving this childhood mystery.","Does anyone remember this game? Help me Reddit, you're my only hope."
Games,"Looks like Borderlands 3 is doing quite well, at least on PC which is the platform we have data about. It reached a peak of [248k concurrent players](https://www.gamesradar.com/borderlands-3-already-has-the-best-numbers-in-gearbox-history-says-gearbox-ceo/) in its first 24 hours. 

If the game had launched on Steam, it would have been the [#5 biggest launch](https://i.imgur.com/CqdXmbw.png) ever recorded in Steam's history, according to data from [SteamCharts](https://steamcharts.com/).

That's an incredible, massive number, and (although admittedly this is speculation) to me it suggests well over 2 million copies sold on PC. 

This is an interesting launch to be observing considering all the controversies surrounding the game, including [lots of technical issues](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-14-borderlands-3-is-suffering-from-a-raft-of-technical-issues-at-launch) and bad performance not only on PC, [but also on the consoles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7IET2C6ks8).

Games,"2 people 1 hentai.

Games,"I just fired up Greedfall and since this title kind of took me by surprise (I am a big RPG fan and never heard of this until launch day) so I wanted to give my impressions of it so far. I have played all of Bioware's older RPGs, a few isometric CRPGs, and many JRPGs. Though I play many different genres, RPGs are my wheelhouse. 

Greedfall didn't hit my radar until it launched, and hearing several major reviewers compare it to Bioware's older work perked my ears up, as I've always been a huge fan of Bioware's RPGs like KOTOR and the older Mass Effects. 

Here are a few things I looked at in sizing the game up in the first hour: 

Animation: The animation is super janky, about on par with Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins. You can tell that there was minimal motion capture done, if any. The worst offender is mouth movements and facial expressions. (Body animations are generally fine.) 

Voice Acting: Thankfully, poor facial animations and lip syncing are countered by Greedfall's strong voice acting. I chose the female protagonist, and her voice actor has a strong clear voice that is pleasant to listen to. 

World Building: I have only wandered around in Greedfall's first area Serene, but you can tell there is obvious care put into the game's environments and general ambiance. The city feels like something out of 1700s Europe. Autumn leaves flutter artfully to the cobblestone streets. Everything looks smokey and damp. You could almost imagine it as a grittier version of Dragon Age's Orlais. Body bags and mass graves from the plague give everything a desperate quality. Textures are absolutely gorgeous. Clothing design is varied and interesting to look at. There is a lot of ambient conversation as you run around that helps to add flavor and flair to the proceedings. Spider definitely hit a home run in the world building and lore, I haven't even been to Teer Fradee and I'm already hooked and want to know more. 

UI: The user interface for this game is pleasantly streamlined. Nothing too artful or fancy, but finding your side quests and missions is easy, there are helpful legends included, and the hand-drawn world map is beautiful. When you're tracking a quest, the marker for it shows up in the directional bar at the top of your screen so you can make your way towards it easily. 

Combat: Combat was never my favorite aspect of Bioware games, and I feel like in Greedfall with Spider I'm still not going to be a huge fan, but I do like the tactical pause option, which allows you to micromanage things a bit. I feel like this game tried to incorporate Soulslike parrying to its combat and some people might like it but I'm personally not a fan. Since combat is not a huge draw for RPGs like this I'll give it a pass though. The game lets you save anywhere as long as you're not in combat or a cinematic, which is a feature I appreciate. I hate having to hump to save points or risk losing progress. It feels like enemies are a bit stout or spongey, and that I have to whittle away their health for awhile before finally being able to kill them, but that is probably due to starter gear and lack of leveling, not design. I'll withhold judgment until I get some grinding done and score some equipment to even things out.  

Crafting: I have looked at the crafting system briefly but because I'm so early in the game I don't have anything to craft. It seems deep though. I'm not much of a crafter in RPGs except for health potions, but I'll update this section as I get a chance to mess with it a bit. I'm not sure how vital crafting is to the upgrade of weaponry and other equipment yet. 

Quests: I have only done a few side quests in the starter area, but the ones I've done are well fleshed-out and feature good dialogue options and choices. Since I'll be leaving this area once I go to the island I'm not expecting any of the decisions I make here to have any really strong influence in latter parts of the game, but it's a nice introduction to the questing system. 

First Hour Verdict: If you want something that has the looks of Dragon Age Inquisition with the mechanics of Dragon Age: Origins, this game so far is like a love letter to Bioware's earlier RPGs. That can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you enjoy that style of choice-based, dialogue-heavy RPG. If you can get past the janky animations and somewhat clunky combat, you'll get sucked into the atmosphere of the game and its characters.",Greedfall: First Hour

Games,"It has been out for a bit now, and because it hasn't released to Steam it's a bit hard to keep track of the overall sentiment towards the game(unless you actually believe anything ""professional reviewers"" write). Only four days ago I purchased the game, and yesterday I completed it. This is partially due to me having a large amount of free time on my hands as of current but mostly because the game is just...short. I completed it in 12 hours, having completed most of the sidequests I ran into and repeatedly tried scouting for more points of interest.

I saw a bunch of reviews on the game. Most noticably Sterling's. I like the guy even if he's a bit overdramatic at times, and I knew his perspective would be biased simply for TOW would give him another angle to take a jab at Bethesda(which made up for an unsurprising 80% of the video's content); but the guy stated this would make ""Bethesda obsolete"". Other reviews stated the game is a masterpiece, intelligent, refreshing and so forth. I am genuinely confused about what people see in this game. It is good, but wildly inconsistent and by no means an unforgettable experience. It also clearly shows, and I guess I'll have to forgive them this, it is *not* a ""triple A"" experience.

In my time with the game there was only a single aspect that impressed me, and that was the writing. The game does not assume the player is a donkey, and doesn't try to be accessible in its geekish jokes. I think TOW has the highest ratio of characters that didn't feel one dimensional I've ever seen in any RPG. Like the rest of the game, this too was inconsistent; some characters were flat to the point of them being see through. Sadly I found the quality of writing to be poorly translated in all companions besides one(the mechanic you meet early on - who did see some development but wasn't that interesting of a character in first place). 

My main gripes with the game laid in the variance of the gameplay. There were some interesting promises I felt were kind of left by the wayside in the final product. One of such were the vending machines; the only difference between different vendors is the color of the armor it offers. Due to the nature of the game I also felt you rarely needed to use the machines for anything other than ammo. There was an idea, but it was left unrealized. When looking at the wiki you'd think the game sports an impressive arsenal of weapons, but in reality it just recycles the same ones prefixed with ""ultra"" or ""2.0"". The modding has hardly any impact on the game. Upgrading, or tinkering as the game calls it, weapons was way too exploitable and overpowered(fast firing weapons would dominate everything by the end of the game). I, to even now don't know if the silencers actually work. Stealth felt, much in line with the rest of the game, inconsistent at best. Enemy AI is flat out bad and didn't show anything even resembling a shred of intelligence. It's kind of sad as I felt the gunplay was kind of on point. Much better than anything I've come to expect from a game of this caliber.

The world, albeit interesting and unique, felt empty and lifeless. Yes, that is part of the setting, but even in locations where it shouldn't be the world felt like an empty decor to quest givers. This might be the biggest let-down of the game for me. The game did not motivate you to explore at any point. Towns are boring and static. NPCs sit in one spot or walk around in circles, repeating the same 1/2 recorded voicelines ad infinitum. The absolute biggest offender in this is the end game town Byzantium. The game builds up(very rapidly, as the game is really brief in everything) to this offensively wealthy and decadent capital where the rich live to leech of the poor workers, but upon you arriving it is a linear pathway with maybe 3 shops in it. It is decorated with points of interests such as bars and shops that are all permanently inaccessible to the player. I felt massive let down ""exploring"" in TOW throughout my entire playthrough.

All in all I think it's an okay game. It is very short, it has clear moments of genius but they are far and in between, in a desolate empty world that really hasn't got anything going for it. I would never pay 60USD for it with the knowledge I have now, probably not even 30.",So about the Outer Worlds[spoilers]

1. Make sure to have 2 PSN accounts. I mainly use US for gaming, I have a second account that's from HK

2. Sign them in (one-by-one) on the Remote Play app and make sure to sync both of them to your PS4 using the Remote Play setting on Settings. 

*NOTE: Do your main account first then sign out. Then, sign in / sync the spare account LAST, after syncing the second account, do not sign out

3. Turn off your PS4 and the Remote Play app

This is where the magic happens:

1. Turn on your PS4 manually, wait for the light to turn white (DO NOT TURN ON YOUR CONTROLLER YET)

2. Open the Remote Play app and press Start, it will automatically open your second account

3. Now press the PS button on your Dualshock 4 then select your MAIN account, it will go to your second account, but all you need to do is...

4. Using the touchscreen controls, log out of the second account. The app will show ""The connection to the PS4 has been lost"" just press ok, then press Start

It was something I took 30 minutes to write and the mods just took it down and refused to answer my DM. Nevertheless I'm going to clean up what I wrote in my last post and format it a bit better. The removal of my previous post still baffles me but whatever. 

There is a lot of misinformation out there about P5R and as one of the few English speaking people who took the time to play the Japanese version I feel like I need to clear them up so here goes.

I'll start of with saying that Yes, this game was absolutely worth it. It has been a long time since I had this much fun with a game and I didn't want to stop playing. I only know basic Japanese and I played most of the game with a camera translator (It worked pretty well for the most part and for those of you who are curious, I used  iTranslate Pro)

Now on to my actual thoughts on the game and why I think it was worth it. I'll keep some things relatively vague because I don't want to really spoil much.

Technical Changes:

The technical changes are very apparent and I think they're not talked about enough. The game feels a lot smoother as a whole and the battles are far quicker thanks to the improved load times, faster animations, equipments that give your teammates new spells,etc. I could make an entire thread on how good the battles feel compared to before but we have other things to discuss here. Aside from the battles you can now run around in towns, the transition screens are much faster everywhere and the load times are almost nonexistent. Also the entire presentation of the game looks far better and colors pop a lot more than before. Just graphically alone,this is the definitive version of the game.

Gameplay Changes:

As I mentioned before, the gameplay feels a lot better on every front. Everything feels much smoother and you have a lot more options to work with. There are new ways to tackle every battle encounter that can get repetitive after a while and that's very welcome for a turn-based JRPG. It's something you have to experience to understand and from the gameplays on YouTube,it might look identical to the original but I assure you it's not. The new areas and treasures in the palaces make them a lot more fun to go through (for once Kamoshida's palace didn't feel like a chore to play through and it's very possible to finish the palace in a day now) and the bosses have new elements that show their personality and cognitions a lot more than before. Also challenge battles really make you think and consider all your options. Getting all three rewards in one go is not easy and you'll probably repeat them multiple times to get the third reward. Mementos is also way more fun and interesting to explore. You can read the changes on the internet, This post is long enough as is.

Story Changes:

The base story is largely the same as we expected but there are a few added scenes and dialogue that can make everything more impactful and sometimes more interesting and fun. Also, the teammates that are in your school all make early cameos which gives them more screentime and it's a good way of knowing how they acted before they even knew you. Also I didn't have much of a problem with the original story and I could look past the flaws here and there (I play games to have fun,not criticize and overthink everything to the point of making it unfun) so I was ok with the story not changing much. I really enjoyed the new confidants and characters and the abilities you get from them are really useful. There are also some changes to some of the existing confidants that improve them heavily and some of the abilities they give you are changed in a really good way (like Ryuji's annoying ambush ability). The third semester is really fun too and it gives everyone a lot more screentime, the interactions are really interesting and the plot-line is genuinely gripping. Also kichijoji is a really nice addition and the new interactions between the phantom thieves add more personality and character to everyone. It's also much easier to Rank up your social links and improve your stats which makes it much easier to max out every confidant and stat on your first playthrough.

My Palace:

The one new feature that doesn't really fit in these categories is the my palace feature. It's a place where you can spend hours and hours and hours in and have a ton of fun and stuff to do. There are also interactions between characters you never see interact with each-other which is always interesting to see. It also provides more challenge and more stuff to do in your everyday life to get more currency and unlock more things. I personally love it and to me, it's the most entertaining thing they added (After the new 3rd semester of course).

Problems:

I had one really big problem with the game. It doesn't ruin the game but it's still something that needs to go. I'm talking about the DLC of course. I think they should make every single DLC free because most of us are already buying the game twice for full price. It's insulting and it shouldn't exist.

Conclusion:

I really loved the game and I don't regret paying full price for it at all. I'm going to buy the game again when the US version releases to fully experience everything in English. I think the DLC has to go and at the very very least should be completely free for the people who already bought the original version of the game.

I recommend the game to the people who really liked the first game and to the people who haven't already played the game. If you didn't like the original, I don't think this is gonna do much for you. Also if you haven't played the game already, wait for the western release. This is the definitive version of Persona 5 in every possible way. Also compared to P4G, this game has a lot more content.

Games,"Recently, there's been a lot of blowback from Pokemon fans about the changes being made to the latest release. I'm not going to comment on whether the outrage is warranted or not, but it got me thinking: is it always the case that people who enjoy playing a game are going to make the best decision about how that game is made?

I think there are always cases where developers become insulated by their own critical or commercial success and need an outside opinion. Games are relatively unique compared to say movies or books in that they are announced and shown to the public while they're still in development, giving the team a chance to implement suggestions in advance.

On the other hand, fans can be capricious and ignorant of the complicated processes involved in game design and popular suggestions aren't always going to make a game more fun.

Yet it's clear community blowback can have an affect on the process. Why do we tolerate this for games when it would be sort of ridiculous to imagine in movies or music? Sure, there are backlashes for those, but they usually occur after the movie is released. People don't complain loudly about movie trailers that they don't like and demand they change, and directors rarely if ever take fan feedback into account for sequels. In fact, the only recent example that comes to my mind where this happened with an in-development movie was with the upcoming Sonic movie. With film and music, people just sort of assume that they don't have a say in what gets released. Film and music, as well as games, are products that live or die on purchases/streams, so audience reception matters.

So what do you think? Are fans ""owed"" representation in game development? Does the studio have the right to decide to ignore outside influence completely, as is common or even expected in other mediums? What's the middle ground?

I very much enjoy games like this- despite it being so unique, it very clearly was inspired by the likes of Portal and, to me, was very reminiscent of The Stanley Parable. I like these trippy, subversive games, even when they're walking simulators, but Superliminal was extra rewarding to play due to the puzzle mechanics.

The core perspective mechanic is unique, interesting, and exciting to play with, but can also be frustrating. I particularly had trouble with puzzles where I had to make an object larger, which usually meant me throwing the object into the sky, dropping it at my feet, and repeating a few times to gradually scale an object to the size I needed. Maybe I just didn't figure out how to do it efficiently, but I got through it! It felt slightly jank at times but overall I very much enjoyed the game and would like to hear other people's thoughts.

First of all I wanna say that I am not trying to shit on the game and sure everyone has their own taste thus if something is a masterpiece it just might not click for me, so I want to know what you guys found fascinating about the game. Here are my thoughts and you might want to correct some of the misunderstanding if you found one:-

Ok so I heard how great the game is and that it was based on a successful books. So being who I am, I always go in with little to no expectations so I won't get spoiled by false hype. Playing the game made me feel as if I am playing a mediocre shooter.

**I will start with what I liked about the game before the criticism:-**

So I went in not knowing what to expect but from the start I realized that it had those intense and scary moments. Like there were jump scare moments that made my heart beat and I loved that. Even some pure horror games fail in the aspect of letting the player hesitate and think thoroughly before taking action. There were times where I was waiting g for the enemies to make their move or wait and hear what is going on. The intensity and horror of the unknown plus the atmosphere, I felt as if I was in the character's shoes, they nailed it! The final mission plus the Library missions were amazing and are my favorite!

**For the negative things:-**

For starters I love stealth mechanics in games but with Metro it kinda felt lame in terms of how you can go full Rambo and complete the stage rather than wait for ages for the NPCs to act. For example in some games you can lure the NPC away from each other and hunt them one by one but here if the enemy notice you they will stay in the same place for ages and move slowly that you have to wait for long before getting the enemy to the location that you want. For example Far Cry 3 stealth was so much fun with how you can keep track of your enemies and can locate all routes and hidden areas without much trouble, but in Metro it is just so dark that sometimes you step on a trap or don't notice alternative routes to attack your enemies from.

The story is...Well I don't know what to say, lots of ambiguity in it. Like who are the dark ones and were they good or bad, I keep thinking to myself ""It is a trilogy thus it might be explained later on just like other trilogies such as Witcher and Mass Effect"" so is that true? Like even the characters were not interesting, for example there are ones that stood out but I didn't feel attached to them. Khan for example felt like an interesting and mysterious character, and the group in the final mission were great but the rest of the cast were *meh.*

In conclusion I didn't get the praise for the game, but may be the praise was for Metro Redux as a whole (2 games and not only the first). The story didn't interest me, may be because after each mission you meet a new guy, follow him around, then the guy dies and you end up either in the enemies hands or in another metro station which just feels boring and non interesting even though whole you walk through the station you hear people talking about different things but it is still not intriguing and you just want to move to the next mission.","So I have just completed Metro 2033 and I must say that I was not impressed by it. I heard praise for it but I tried to come in with low expectations however even though the game nails the great and intense atmosphere, it felt lacking in terms of characters development and overall story.(NO SPOILER)"

Games,"TLDR: we made a highly skill-based, bullet-hell MMO designed to encourage people to make friends and form an awesome community. You can download it for [free on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/386010/Steambirds_Alliance/) 

---------------

Hey everyone - I'm the CEO of Spry Fox, a 10-year-old indie studio. We've made games like Realm of the Mad God, Triple Town, Alphabear, Steambirds, and a bunch more. I used to be the guy who managed the Xbox LIVE Arcade game portfolio, way back when that was a thing. I'm hoping to get some of you interested in a new project of ours.

Anytime I hear about a game designed to encourage friendship, it's either highly experimental, not very skill-based, or both. There are exceptions, but they're pretty rare. So for the past six years, we've been working on a free-to-play COOP MMO called ""Steambirds Alliance"" that tries to thread the needle between being extremely skill-based and highly coop-centric. Those two things, when meshed together, typically result in a lot of toxicity as more skilled players flame noobs and make them feel unwanted. 

I should mention that SBA is based on Realm of the Mad God, which we co-developed back in 2011, but at this point SBA's design has diverged a fair amount from RotMG's design. There are still similarities, but SBA is substantially more focused on encouraging friendship.

If you like the sound of a free, coop, bullet-hell MMO, or if you're curious about our design philosophies around making it as fun to play with strangers as possible, I'd be grateful if you checked SBA out and gave us some feedback. You can read more about our friendship-centric [design philosophy](https://steambirds.com/2019/08/21/why-we-made-steambirds-alliance/), [download SBA for free](https://store.steampowered.com/app/386010/Steambirds_Alliance/) and/or [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/steambirds), where we've got a community 10k strong that is easily one of the nicest and most welcoming communities you will find anywhere in games.

X019 is right around the corner and after the success and feedback from our BlizzCon 2019 Megathread we have decided to do the same for X019 as well! Just as before, this is a less strict version of our rules that we usually implement for E3 and The Game Awards.

##Plans for X019 on /r/Games

- We'll have one stickied megathread up before X019 starts, with the suggested sort for comments set to new for everyone to chat in with their reactions. This megathread will link to the livethreads hosted on other subreddits. 

- Moderators will create and maintain this megathread, updating it with links to discussion posts throughout the convention.

- **We will allow individual news posts (related to/revealed at the X019 event)** outside the megathread, as long they get tagged with **[X019]** in the title, and will link to each discussion post in our stickied X019 megathread. 

- Any submissions about X019 announcements without the [X019] tag will be removed, but starting the day after X019 ends, you can submit your own regular posts about it without the tag. We'll also remove duplicates, unless the post has more significant information than an earlier post. We require links to the original source wherever possible.

- The [new.reddit.com collection feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/bgibu9/an_update_on_making_it_easier_to_host_events_on/) we experimented with got good feedback so we will be using that again as well.

To be extra clear - news or discussions that are not related to X019 will still be allowed during the event. The above tag/megathread only concerns the X019 event itself and any related news.

Games,"I'm really looking for a new open world survival game to play. Started liking these games a lot since I tried 'Conan Exiles' and, especially, 'The Forest'.

Found out about 'Citadel: Forged with Fire' last night and have been tempted to get it. People aren't really saying the best things about it though. 

Like to hear opinions on it from anyone who enjoys Conan Exiles and/or The Forest so at least we share somewhat similar interests.",People who enjoy survival games like Conan Exiles and The Forest: How's 'Citadel: Forged with Fire'?
Games,"Apologies for the self-indulgent post, but I feel compelled since there still might be folks out there trying to make up their mind. And the long-short of it is this: I don't think anyone should be able to convince you one way or the other with any review; you've sort of just got to play it and see if you like it.

It's slow. It's tedious. It's mundane. But it's so unlike any other typical game. A lot of people have complained about the first few hours, and yes, they are sort of brutal. I don't know that I necessarily had ""fun"" playing them, but I appreciate them so much. The struggle to traverse is so difficult and laborious that when you finally break out and get *something* to help you transport, it feels like a glorious victory. It's got that same sense of progression of a looter-shooter, but x1000. 

And once you progress out of the first few hours, the game does open up and there's a lot more freedom and breathability. People say to speed through to that part as fast you can and sure, I can see why. But I actually kind of wish I had stayed in the opening a little more, just to deepen my appreciation for the next part. 

Again, I don't know that any review can really swing someone on the fence trying to decide if slowly moving over rocks while trying not to fall down is fun until you just play it and feel it yourself. But I will say, if you like games where you sort of get lost in random side quests and building up an open world through doing little things, this is your game. The game is like 90 percent side quests, and then has side quests within the side quests, like building the highway. That is the single most addicting thing I've ever encountered in a game. I stayed up until like 4 am last night because I needed to raid one more MULE camp and getting a little more metal to finish this paver out and oh, well the next one is just 400 short on ceramics so I might as well do that one too. And then seeing other players come along and contribute is such an enjoyable sense of camaraderie in a game unlike anything I've ever experienced. 

I really don't know how to explain Death Stranding. It's so meticulous and pays so close attention to the details. It doesn't miss anything. And it just keeps handing you enough carrots to keep you moving forward. 

The story is fine and I'm into it, but it's weird because it's Kojima. But I don't think you should be buying it for some incredible plot and story. There are some twists and turns and pretty neat surprises, but they really just enhance the so-called bland, mundane open world stuff. 

I love the game. I labored over whether or not to get it because I couldn't tell if that gameplay loop was for me or not. But after spending a lot of time with it, I can confidently say it *very* much is for me.","I struggled deciding whether to buy Death Stranding and after playing for around 30 hours, I think it might be my favorite game ever"

Games,"Sup lads, as the title suggests this thread is for discussion on gaming tropes that you've come to hate to see in newly released games.

One of my pet peeves is the overuse of notes being left around random areas where characters detail their personal thoughts and desires. My problem isnt so much with the format but more how lazily and oddly it's used. A page here, a page there, often in the most random places, like who does that? And it often feels like a poor replacement for proper environmental storytelling, or efficient storytelling.

Games,"After seeing that most of the reviews for stadia were done on internet speeds that are much higher than the average consumer. I thought it would be interesting to compare the server on different and more realistic internet speeds.

**TL:DR at the bottom.**

So these are the locations I tested:

* At my house, which has a 70 mbit connection.
* My university, which has a 200 mbit connection.
* Friends house, which has a 30 mbit connection.

I tested 2 games, AC odyssey and Thumper. One game that doesn't suffer under latency, one game that suffers a lot with latency. 

To start, my house. First I tested using the CCU that's connected via ethernet. For both AC and Thumper, the image quality and framerate were outstanding. The games ran very well and in 5 hours of AC I didn't have a single moment of blur or frame drops.
The latency side of things is slightly less positive, in Thumper I noticed a slight delay. Because it is a rhythm game, it was still easily playable. But in a game like Mortal Kombat, I could see it being a bigger issue. I didn't really notice any delay in AC, but that game barely suffers from delay so it's not that important.

Then I switched to my pc, still at home, which is connected via wifi. As soon as I started up AC I noticed the quality was pretty bad. The game looked blurry and frame rate was dropping a lot. I then switched to the 720p option. After this the game ran much better, there were still some moments where it looked blurry. But this is probably due to the fact that I used wifi, which obviously isn't as stable as ethernet. As for Thumper, game ran perfect at the highest setting. As should be expected from this game. For latency it was better than my experience with the CCU. Once I turned down the settings, I didn't notice any delay in AC. In Thumper I couldn't see the delay while playing. Only after looking back at the video I made in slowmo I noticed some slight delay. But as said it was not a hindrance during gameplay.

The next test was at my university playing on my laptop. The university has an outstanding connection, which is to be expected from a uni. Quality wise the graphics were basically the same as on the CCU. There were a few occasions of blur, but that's probably due to the fact that i was  in a room with 20 others all using their PC on the same connection. For latency it was the same as on my pc at home, which makes sense as I used the wired Stadia controller on both, Overall this was my best playing experience. Not a surprise as it was the best network i played on.

This last test is probably the most interesting one. My friend doesn't have the best internet connection, 30 mbps, so this would be one of the harder tests for stadia. We tested using the CCU, hooked up via ethernet. The stadia app recognized that the connection wasn't ideal, and thus already recommended the medium quality. The graphics experience was pretty mixed. For a few hours the quality was very stable at 720p. But after that there were instances of blur (about every 2 minutes). The latency was the same as on my CCU at home. 


After my first week with stadia i'm pretty content with it. For a game like AC Odyssey its an amazing service, as long as you can run it on the highest setting. On the other side I would not play games that heavily rely on latency on stadia. Playing on pc using the controller wired is pretty playable. But not as good as the pc. Playing via the CCU is just a bad option for a game that needs low latency. 

I hope you enjoyed this review of stadia, and then it gave you a different perspective on the server.

**TL:DR**

* 70 mbit,CCU,Ether: Graphics=Excellent, Latency=bad.
* 70 mbit,PC,Wifi: Graphics=decent, Latency=good.
* 200 mbit,PC,Wifi: Graphics=Excellent, Latency=good.

Games,"Saw a few other threads about best/underrated games and it got me thinking what the most disappointing games of the past ten years have been. For me, there are a few:

- **Anthem -** This one should be obvious. I was excited to try it out, playing it for a few hours, and decided to not waste anymore time on it. The gameplay felt good but the story felt very lackluster and overall it seems like a huge step back for live service games.

- **Mass Effect: Andromeda -** Okay, I never actually played this one and I don't think I can bring myself to do it. Mass Effect 1-3 are some of my favorite games of all time and I don't want to tarnish that with Andromeda. Maybe I'll play it someday, but as a Mass Effect game, it doesn't look fun.

- **Brink-** I was so hyped for this game pre-release, as were all of my friends. Parkour, shooting, customization, and co-op sounded amazing when it released in 2011. While it was fun for a while, it ended up being very disappointing. It felt clunky and I remember running into a ton of issues playing with friends. I also didn't like how the multiplayer, co-op, and single player was all the exact same thing with no variety.","The 2010s are ending, so what do you think are the top 10 most disappointing games of the decade?"

Welcome to the **END OF THE DECADE** discussion thread series! As this decade draws to a close, we're taking a look back at the past decade of gaming. Every week, on Mondays, we'll post a new week-long discussion thread featuring a console released in the past decade. If you're missing the regular 'Suggest Me a Game' or 'Free Talk Friday', you can find them linked in the sidebar.

The Playstation Vita, a handheld console developed by Sony, [was first announced at E3 2011](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-07-ngp-playstation-vita-european-price). It first released in Japan in December of 2011 before launching shortly after in other territories in 2012. It was considered the successor to the Playstation Portable. The console saw a revamp with the release of the PS Vita 2000 series, which featured a smaller console along with extended battery life and a LCD screen. The PlayStation TV was based off the Vita, which let people play PS Vita games on a television screen. It sold approximately 4 million consoles by the end of 2012, although Sony stopped releasing sales figures after this point, leaving the total sales numbers unknown at this time. The Playstation Vita [boasts a library of over 1500 titles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_PlayStation_Vita_games) The Playstation Vita ceased production in March 2019. 

In the thread, discuss what you think of the Playstation Vita. How did it contribute to the past decade of gaming? What games do you consider the highlight, your favorites, of the Playstation Vita era? What did you expect from it and how do you think it fared overall? What did you wish you had seen on the Playstation Vita? Share your answers and insights into the Playstation Vita in this thread!

Games,"I played tons and tons and tons of versus mode in Left 4 Dead. Something about the 4v4 matchup was so ridiculously fun, especially when we started messing around with modded content or servers. It's some of the most fond memories I have of multiplayer gaming.

So it's baffling to me that no game has tried to swoop in since players left for other things and try that mode for themselves, because it had a massive and dedicated community for years that would serve any game well. And it isn't like it would be particularly hard - multiple other games have used the Left 4 Dead formula for a coop survival kind of game(Vermintide being the best example IMO), while other games have taken the versus concept but changed it to a more deliberately unequal setting, usually 4v1. Fun for sure, but not the same experience at all.

Some developer needs to hop on this train stat, because I'm seriously ready to throw my money at the first good game that does it. In particular, I could see this working extremely well for a Marvel licensed game, fighting through hordes of hydra agents/skrulls/Ultron bots/whatever while getting ambushed by special variations, and occasionally some boss fights mixed in.","Left 4 Dead vs mode is probably the most untapped potential I've seen in gaming, and it's honestly a little baffling to me."
Games,"With the decade coming to a close there's no doubt that its been a great one for video games, but I wanted to know what reddit thought the most influential games of the 2010's were.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my picks:

**Minecraft**: If there was a decade defining game, it would be minecraft. It's hard to understate how much of a success this game really is, from a blocky creative tool you could play in your browser, minecraft has launched to become the top selling game of all time, and in the hands of the community has become everything from a competitive sport, a teaching tool, or a platform to build computers out of redstone. It's popularity has helped shape countless other games this decade, from games that make use of procedural worlds like no mans sky, to games that have taken a more direct influence such as terraria or the upcoming Hytale. 

**Dark Souls:** Even if Demon Souls did everything dark souls did, dark souls was certainly the game to popularize From Softwares brand of ruthless difficulty in a dying world. This game has spawned off an entire sub-genre of ""souls-likes"" and alot of ideas that Dark Souls has helped to popularize have started to creep their way into AAA games as well, like Jedi Fallen Order

**Fez, Super Meat Boy, among others:** With the boom in popularity of minecraft in the early 2010's many people were being opened up to the idea of a highly successful indie game, and games such as Fez, Super Meat Boy, FTL: Faster Than Light, Hotline Miami, and Bastion laid the ground work for the type of indie games scene that we see today. Indie games can be absolutely huge hits now, with games like Celeste, Hollow knight, Disco Elysium, and Into the Breach getting a huge amount of attention for being made by such small teams, and I think they all owe it in part to some of the early XBLA and kickstarter hits.",What are the most influential games of the 2010's?
Games,"My personal choice would be a reboot/remake of the 2002 Choro Q game 'Road Trip Adventure'. As a kid I absolutely LOVED that game, the bright and cartoonish open world to explore, all the characters, the amazing customization and multiple interesting races and challenges. I would kill to see this be remade for today's consoles, I think it could be a real unheralded success. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, what do you guys wanna see remade?",Which lesser known game would you love to see remastered?
Games,"First, let me start by saying that I hate Stadia, I don't hate the people that like it, I just hate it, I hate the very concept of cloud gaming, for me, and for many people informed about how the Internet infrastructure works, hearing about Stadia is the equivalent of hearing about someone who is trying to make a 3 wheel car (and I know they exist allright!).

However, I feel like Stadia screwed it big time, not by the technology they built, but by the games they chose.

Think of all those really amazing games that have almost no visibility whatsoever and that are absolutely not input lag sensitive, turn based RPGs? Visual Novels? There is a golden mine of truely exeptional experiences that deserves so much more attention, but no, they focused on big games that are super latency dependant, bringing Destiny 2 (are you even serious...) and games that have super complex visuals that will be hugely deteriorated by the video compression (which has already been proven massive, even on very good setups).

I can see a usefulness to Stadia, even if again, I really don't like it, but they need to shift focus fast and look at games that can work on their infrastructure, otherwise people are just going to throw it away and Stadia will forever be remembered as a scam.",Google Stadia is a massive missed opportunity.
Games,"Any time I talk to someone who doesn't really play fighting games, the thing that they care the most about when buying one is either IP or content.

Smash sells because it has Nintendo characters and a shit ton of stuff to do even if you're playing alone.  Almost all the best selling fighting games have some claim to the single player throne.  

* All the 3D MKs.
* Tekken 3
* Street Fighter Alpha 3 
* Soul Calibur 1,2 and 4

I remember reading some crazy statistic that like 70% of the people who buy fighting games never play a single ranked match.  Simplifying mechanics is the wrong way to drive sales/longevity for a game because casual players don't care about trying to play seriously to begin with.  Just like how most RTS players played custom maps and the single player campaign and never touched a ladder match.  

Most players just want to -- as Ed Boon once put it -- hit buttons and have cool shit happen.  And then on top of that, they want enough single player content to justify a purchase even if they don't plan on being competitive.  The majority of players have neither the desire, nor the time to try and go pro in a competitive game.  

All you do by simplifying mechanics is alienate core players, while altering things most casual players couldn't care less about to begin with.  

Not to mention, oversimplifying a game makes hardcore players bitter about the game, and they're far less likely to recommend it to other prospective customers.  Look at the vitriol SF5 gets anytime someone asks if they should buy it.  Meanwhile, look at how well Tekken 7 is doing right now, despite being one of the most complicated fighting games out there.  People think it's cool to watch and when they ask about it, they get a ton of positive feedback.",Oversimplifying mechanics is the wrong way to sell fighting games to casual players
Games,"For me (and this will make me unpopular but) Nier: Automata was just not that special. 

I was really looking forward to it but it never landed for me. It raised plenty of questions, but none of them were even close to unique, and the game didn't even try to answer them, or provide interesting viewpoints. Even then it kind of forgot about what it was trying to say and turned into a soap opera with characters I think I was meant to care about.. but didn't.

The gameplay was okay, I found the chips system finicky. The story was pretty shallow and, I'm sorry, I'm happy to play the same story from a different perspective but when the second character's run is *almost identical* to the first. That's not okay. That's tedious. 

I even watched Clemp's 4-Part, 2hr 40mins analysis of the game to make sure I wasn't missing anything and maybe help explain why everyone was saying it's the best game ever made. I wasn't missing anything. I just never understood at what point I was supposed to *care*.

Games,"Hello my name is Madtime69 and I got to play Project XCloud, So back in 2018 Microsoft announced Project XCloud with very few details but people guess that it could be a streaming service, they where right and when I hear Streaming Service I just yawn because we have seen in the past that streaming games has not been that good especially when it comes to consoles, PSNow which was meant to be this big streaming service that would blow people away with how well it worked but it just turned out underdeveloped at launch with the streams having input lag and screen tearing and this is still true today with the launch of Google Stadia not only having input lag and screen tearing but also having feature which they said they would have missing at launch so I did not have that much hope in Project XCloud but let's see if it can impress me.

______________________________________________

Preparing To Use Project XCloud

______________________________________________

So the first thing that you need to know before playing XCloud is you need a Xbox controller which is Bluetooth enabled so you can't use the original Xbox One controller.

And even though it's not recommended it would encourage you to get a controller clip for your phone to make it easier to use and to look more like a handheld console. You would also benefit from making your router 5ghz instead of 2.4ghz.

And the last thing you need is to download the app which is free and that's all you need for the setup so in total I spent about £60.

______________________________________________

Testing Games

______________________________________________

Forza Horizon 4

So I started with Forza Horizon 4 mainly because it's the game I played the most of out of the 50 included.

This is a really bad way of playing it, the audio like to cut out a lot and the stream will lag for less then a second but the input has little to no lag, to my eyes there is also image compression because it looks more grainy and less sharp as it would be on the Xbox One, I had only got this game to run good ones and that was when I set my router to 5ghz.

It got a little better but still very laggy but putting it to 5ghz probably made the other games play fantastic so with a little bit more optimization it will probably be good and I mainly say that after experiencing the next game.

Bloodstain : Ritual Of The Night

This game works perfectly, there is no lag, no screen tearing and the image quality is really good but I think that's down to it having assets that are small in the first place, if the assets where bigger I might of been about to see some compression. So if you sat me down and ask me to identify been two bits of footage which was on the console and which was streamed I would not be able to tell.

Devil May Cry 5

So this was my first time playing DMC5 and after not liking the HD versions of them on PC I found myself pleasantly surprised that I loved it, now I only played the prologue but from that about 5 to 10 minutes of play I was surprised on how well it played for being a 3D visually demanding game. There was yet again no lag, no screen tearing and no input lag.

______________________________________________

Xbox Console Streaming

______________________________________________

There is also the ability to stream games from your Xbox One so if there is a game not in the 50 to select from you can pick from any games you have then stream them to your device. I could not test this because I right now can't get to my Xbox One right now.

______________________________________________

Conclusion

______________________________________________

So Project XCloud is amazing compared to the competition especially Google Stadia, it just works, all you do is click on a icon and in a few minutes you have a console perfect version of the game but without the console, almost, there are a few things that will hold it back and that is that not all games will run equally as good and it all depends on having a good internet connection and that's the bottleneck for every streaming service especially game streaming services, for stuff like Netflix it's ok to have a little bit of loading and buffering but for game streaming where you control what happens on the game, that type of crap is unacceptable.

My final rating for this service is 8 out of 10, very good but has a few problems.

Games,"They literally dont allow you to fight back at all. I was playing shoothouse 24/7 and someone would throw a stun from one side of the map into the middle and it would stun me everytime and not allow me to aim or move for around 10 seconds. How am i supposed to fight back? How is that fun for me? 

Now i have heard everyone say GeT gUd sCrUb everytime i bring it up but it doesnt give you a possibility of winning that fight. Especially when the whole enemy team has one and 2 come flying your way which is almost more common then just one... What can i do cuz it makes me not be able to have fun since im forced to lay prone and hope they dont see me.

Ive tried the perk and you still rarely live to them. Its too big of an advantage and needs to have only a 1 or 2 second stun effect or not take my ability to aim away. 

The reason people hate Mei in overwatch is because you cant defend yourself when she ults unlike when Zarya and Sigma ult you can still shoot and aim. Power should never be taken away like that. Id rather go up against 3 tanks with no cover in Modern warfare in ground war cuz at least i can bob and weave and maybe dodge a few shells till i get to cover but the stun is a guaranteed death and it needs to be removed or toned down.",Modern Warfare 2019 What am i supposed to do against stun grenades?
Games,"Bit of a tall order, but was wondering if someone could  recommend more Ps4 games like say Conan:Exiles or No  Man’s sky.  And where that have distinct soloplayer mode or at least can create a closed network where i can play by myself. Basically that hybrid freeroam/action adventure/building genre that Conan Exiles and Apex seems to belong to.  Also they should at least have the option for 3rd person perspective.

Games,"First off, system info. Xbox One or medium-low spec PC. 

In short, I'm asking for anyone that can recommend a game that nails the ""discovering new content"" feeling and tension in games like Destiny, The Division or Generation Zero without ever feeling like I'm in a loop, as a solo player. Preferably action oriented gameplay, although a Generation Zero with more story and a hell of a lot less bugs sounds very appealing. I'm looking for a game that will make me forget I'm in a game, for a considerable amount of time (both in terms of sitting and sustained playing over ideally, months).

To explain further, I'm in a bit of a drout at the moment. I'm a lover of story heavy games where I can wander endlessly and not feel like I'm repeating content. When Destiny 1 released, I adored it. The campaign itself was mediocre, but I dove headfirst into the universe and lore. For months. Then, the grind started. I was doing the same things over and over and over. Then, the monetisation was added on top of this. The only bits where I truly was absorbed was the first time in new areas, like strikes and raids. I dropped it in the second year.

I haven't had a game give me that wonderous feeling, that tension, all sewn up together with good quality since. It's truly been years since I enjoyed a game while forgetting that it was a game. I don't have something that I jump into playing at 9pm and suddenly it's 4 in the morning and I feel compelled to have more, week after week. I'm always aware of the loop in the first week or so, and so I lose that feeling, that enjoyment I'm chasing.  

I'm not asking for a Roguelike with a clearly defined loop, in fact I already have one of those. Deep Rock Galactic is a fantastic fps roguelike that I've been enjoying immensely, it just doesn't scratch this particular itch. Genuinely fantastic game though, nothing against it.

I'm looking for something with solid gameplay, that's well put together and immersive. I know this sounds like a ""dream game"" and I know this is quite subjective, but I'm sitting here for hours with this want for a game like this, a want that something like Destiny used to satisfy with it's new content drops. Nothing sticks out to me at the moment and I'm a bit lost. 

Any input is greatly appreciated, thanks for your time.","Looking for a game that nails the ""discovering new things"" feeling over a long period of time"

Games,"I just replayed it after 15 years. Yes, it lost some of its charm due to numerous memes and well known plot. Outdated graphics do not help. But man, there were moments where I could not play further. It's super scary.

​

This is not the type of horror like Resident Evil or similar. RE is a lemonade. This is pure horror.

If you can overcome its clunkiness and very outdated graphics, and if you like mystery games with a story and not too much focus on action, give it a shot and see why it is regarded one of the scariest games of all times, even today.

​

Yes VR have dethrone it. In VR, even a crappy horror game is sooooo scary. I think that SH scares are similar to VR scares. Combine the two, and I would not last 3 seconds. I would be scared for my health. (I have not played PT demo)

​

I remember when I first played it and did not know what I am getting myself into. It was very immersive. So mysterious and interesting. And when I got into school I could not continue due to spookiness. But I had to. Story was very interesting. I played it in small doses.

When I got into another school, I was hugely surprised. It was awesome and just became infinitely scary. And I thought first school was scary enough.

And man, game just could not stop with increasing the fears. Just when i thought the worse is over, I was heading to a hospital....

​

There were couple of reasons why someone might not find it scary:

-You are a streamer. This is the worst case scenario and not a valid way of playing. You are constantly talking, chatting with audience, and checking messages every few seconds. You were not immersed at all.

-You did a let's play on Youtube. Better than streaming, but still, you are constantly talking and worry about screening time. You were somewhat immersed.

-You watched playthrough on Youtube. Even if you did everything right, watched no commentary playthrough, watched in silence with lights off, it is incomparable with actually experiencing it yourself. It's just not the same. You were not the part of the game/world and you can't feel the same fear. You were half immersed.

-You played it properly but still don't think it's scary? Well, maybe it is not your type of game and you tried to play it by force. Not enjoying it.

Or maybe you were too detracted by its clunkiness and outdated graphics. You could not overcome it.

Or maybe it is just the fact that times have changed, and we can't get immersed in games like we used to, before internet. We got used to everything in games and we are overwhelmed by content.

But for real now, some things I want to clarify before I deep dive in the matter. 

1. This is not, by any means, a ""witch hunt"" or an attack of any type and for anybody, be insiders, gaming companies, PR departments, journalists, gamers, etc. As I may name a few of them in this post.
2. This is thought to be a discussion around a topic I've seen quite a lot, to the eyes of all, yet it's like it goes unnoticed in the big ocean of gaming news we have every month, every week, every day...
3. I think this is a great community where we can discuss this seriously and I believe (as I've already stated in the title) it's something this community owes to itself and I thought that we should have it now, before 2020 arrives, which we know it's gonna be quite something in all gaming related things, from really heavy hitters games to the new generation of consoles coming all around the corner.
4. This may be quite a large post as I try to cover every aspect of it, I'll try to be as concise as I can, but please bear with me if you're interested in the topic so we can have a nice discussion around it without a simple ""TL;DR"".

&amp;#x200B;

# The elephant in the room:

So, yeah, I'm talking about ***RUMORS,*** and everything that revolves around it. So this means: 

* ***RUMORS (per-se):*** Everything that just is a... well... a ""Rumor"", every gaming news that is not yet officially confirmed by the company in charge of certain game or hardware that is gaming related (and even sometimes not so gaming related). Be this rumors an ""all but confirmed"" or a ""just a post from 4chan take this with a grain of salt"" situation.
* ***Insiders (and/or whistleblowers)***: So this are the so called ""insiders"", they have contact with (or are themselves) workers at the gaming industry, in some gaming company. So they can aquire information before it releases officially and communicate thing to the general public, more often than not, vaguely and in a cryptic manner.
* **Gaming journalism**: so here may come the first little bit of controversy around this topic. Why do I name the gaming journalism to play a *big role* in all this thing about rumors? Well, because they actually do. We're not to judge if they're good or bad at what they do, but thing is, they are dedicated to give news to the gaming community, and sometimes (now more and more) that means they have to give news based on Rumors, because these are the first thing that appears before any official confirmation.
* **The gaming community as a whole**: yep. You, watching and reading this. Me, creating this topic. We, clicking on every news about a rumor, a possibility about that game you're waiting for, that console you want to know how's gonna be, that gaming show that will present game trailers, etc etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what about it? Why do I want to bring this up?:

Well, to begin with, I've lost count on how many times I've seen the legend \[RUMOR\] before a title. I'm talking specifically here, in r/Games, but it's not something specific of this community. I've also seen it in other gaming communities, large and small alike and in countless news in gaming dedicated sites.

This thing has taken all over the gaming community as silently as a perfect run in a Hitman level. It's astonishing how *rumors* have become increasingly a form of news that now more often than not, revolves around being some kind of rumor.

And the thing is, as I've previously stated, they can range from a highly true thing that is all but confirmed, to a random guy in the internet that states his uncle works for \[insert gaming company\] and you should trust him. So yeah, those are evitable the majority of the times, but how about all the grey areas that are in between them? How many times we believed something that sounded really true or possible until we found out it was all but a clickbait to feed off of this community?

Well, that may be one of the important things I'm trying to point out with this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

# Don't worry, not soon the ambigüity will not end:

I'm sorry, what!?

So yeah, I need to bring this and point out that a lot of the times, when we talk about rumors, we're talking about a rumor started by ***official companies' staff,*** and their not so fun ambigüity.

So, have you seen... let's see... those tweets of known people from the industry? What were they stating? What are they talking about? What in the seven hells is *soon**^(tm)*?

Let me enlighten you with a few examples. We've had some awesome games starring this superhero called Batman. They were done by this certain company. People really liked those games and are eager to have another installment in the Arkham universe. So they're waiting for any news about it, however gaming companies tend to remain silent as much as they can with what and how they're working on it, but sometimes they give little tidbits of what's happening inside them (and sometimes these happen without the company consent, but nevertheless they happen). So wrapping up, if you're a gamer and a gaming news consumer you might have hear, all throughout 2019 that a new Batman game might be announced in \[insert closest next gaming show\] just to be dissapointed again and again and again, with radio silence from the company in charge of the game. 

HOWEVER, is this your fault? It's certainly not if you've seen people that work at the company openly tweeting about ""working in a new Batman game that is gonna be announced REALLY ***SOON******^(TM)***"".

So, how soon is ***soon***? We'll never know. A span of time may vary and be highly relative depending on the person and the subject. It's 10 years too much time? Maybe for me or for you it's a lot of time but it may be too little for all the entire history of humanity. 

So for a guy that's been working on a game for the past 5 years, a few months may be really little time, maybe half a year, or a full year it's ""soon"" for them, while for you that it's a ton of time for just an announcement.

And people are left talking about when is this gonna be announced, how is gonna be announced, what is going to be the game about, what platform is going to be for, etc etc etc, all but ***RUMORS,*** supossitions, nothing official. Which tends to rise new rumors around the original rumor, like games canceled that are well under development (or the other way around).

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing about this love for ambigüity. I'm talking about the cryptic way of communicating this things. Have you seen Bluepoint's tweets? They've been tweeting some cryptic stuff in the form of poems, making people do all kind of assumptions, suppositions and whatnot.

Ey! I get it, it's a way of saying ""hey we're working on something cool for you that we're not ready to announce just yet, please wait while I let you know that we're totally working on this but I cannot totally tell you, please, have this"". I'm just stating what this also brings with it, which is the not so fun part about it.

&amp;#x200B;

But sometimes, and just sometimes, this ambigüity comes as something ""necessary"". You see, this whistleblowers, they need to remain anonymous if they don't want to get caught and be fired. Some of them communicate directly to the community, while others and most often now, tend to make their stuff being told by ""community insiders"", creating this personalities that become news machines themselves. 

So yeah, how many times have you seen a tweet from a guy known for leaking stuff? And this are just taken as serious news, that's the time we live in and how things are now. But there's this, again, ambigüity, a lot less serious, and sometimes it could hurt. That's why I want to bring the Resident Evil 3 case.

There's a person known for having inside info about Resident Evil games development. This info is passed to him by a whistleblower. So this guy gives information for the gaming community that wants to know, for example if we were going to have a Resident Evil 3 remake like REmake2, if they were going to work on it before or after RE8, and so on. So, do you remember this discussion that sprung some months ago about RE3 being outsourced and that it was not going to be nothing like RE2 at all? Well there you got it. RE3 was indeed in development and it's going to be just as fleshed out (I'm talking just what we could see in the trailer and that it's the same genre, perspective, etc, in the game) as RE2. While we discussed if it was going to be just another company that was not CAPCOM who was making it, that it was going to be  co-op, that it was going to be multiplayer only, and a neverending etc. 

All of this just because of this industry of wanting to be the first communicating some news, of having privileged information, but being communicated with such ambigüity that distorts everything on its path and becomes hurting. Which brings me to the next point.

&amp;#x200B;

# Sometimes it hurts and it's not cool:

Just continuing with the same example of RE3. We could see how the misinformation (be this intentional or not) could hurt a game announcement. How this insider info became a combination of ambigüity, misunderstandings with Resident Evil Resistance and RE3 and poor communication brought us a warm announcement which otherwise could be a top gaming moment of the year.

*I want to make a side note on this, as a lot of this misfortune had to do with a leak that was all on CAPCOM's side (yeah there's also this gaming journalism site that just shares it with everyone but there's that) that sometimes happen and we know are not at all made on purpose but just honest mistakes.*

Back to the main point. There's been plenty of companies talking out loud how all this ""side industry"" of rumors, leaks, and privileged info hurts them. Where they're working hard for years and just want to have a good announcement and see how the community will react, and being that thing ruined by some tweet from a person either screaming ""Hey have my attention"" and/or a site not totally telling ""give me that clicks for that juicy money"".

**This is an important point I wanted we discuss, this could be one of the worst things about all this rumors, insiders and so on. You should take your actions with responsability and although we all belong to the same community and want the best for it, you could be really hurting someone for, sometimes, just some false recognition.**

Again, as I stated in the beginning of this post, I'm not at all in favor of any kind of ""witch hunting"". I just want to make visible the worst part of this and that we should not ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

# In the middle, the burnout. And is the cure worst than the disease?:

Maybe this is the reason I'm making this post. Maybe I'm just burned out. Maybe I'm just tired of so much rumors, so much info that is not, so much talking, so much...

I'm watching at a list of *possible* games that could be given away by Epic in their last 12 games of the year of giveaways. Yeah, some leaked info by some leaker guy, etc. Some games may appear, some not. I don't know. 

I'm seeing this new *possible* joystick for the new PS5. Yeah, some leaked info from some patent filled in another continent.

...

And so one gets burned out. I think the best example of rumors, leaks, and insider info burning someone out could be the Half-Life series and the infamous Half-Life 3.

This game could have a movie made just around all the false rumors and stuff that srpung over the span of 12 years of waiting. And what happened? People got burned out. Yeah, there was this time where you saw discussions about what could possibly be the new Half-Life, turn into things like ""meh, I'm done, I don't care until I see super-official-firsthand confirmation by Valve themselves, until then, bye"".

And in this year, 2019 we got Half-Life: Alyx, and all the rumors and talking were crushed under the real thing, which is the best thing, and I'll talk about it in the last point.

# Sometimes IT IS cool:

Some people just become really known and reliable sources of ""inside"" information. Some of the them communicate things that we couldn't not known otherwise.

 I mean, for example, I've lost count on how many times we have had news with a Jason Shreirer (sorry if it's badly written) tag on it. Assuring this is ""verified seal"" quality info. Yeah, sometimes he or any other may go too far and fall in the ""Yes it hurts"" category, but they brought us info about some things that needed to be known by all the community that some companies were doing some not at all cool stuff.

**So not everytime it's always all bad things. We should take the good too.**

And that brings us to the last point, the good.

&amp;#x200B;

# At the end, the real deal is always the best deal:

Do you remember when the Resident Evil 7 logo appeared? How freak out were the people? That was really cool. When Shenmue 3 was announced, when the Remake appeared under that FFVII, when we saw Leon in that first RE2 trailer.

Half-Life: Alyx ending more than a decade of speculation. And when the game launches Geoff Keighley (again, sorry if I write full names bad) will have a special of ""The Final Hours"" talking about all that happened in Valve in the last decade. 

**Aren't these the best things? When you can finally see and are surprised with the trailer of the game you've been waiting for? I think they steamroll over rumors and clickbaity notes with rumors all over it. At the end, the real deal is the best deal.**

# What should we do? Ending thoughts:

Well, that's what I'm asking. What should we do? We should discuss this. Try to see the good and the bads of it, try to understand all the sides. But over all, try to make the best out of it and always improve the gaming community and not fall under the cheap gossip of this ""side industry"".

I'm not saying we should erase Rumors from the entire industry, nor I'm saying we should embrace it either.

I just wanted to make this theme a little more visible to all, so we can be a little bit more critic (in the good way) and think more and better at what we're doing with our time and how could we be hurting or helping some people without not even realizing it.

Believe or not, I left some things out but it was just too damn long of a post, apologies for that.

Games,"So I recently started a Google Stadia Pro membership, I had received a promotional code for it for Christmas. I was very skeptical of the service due to all the complaints I've heard online, now I wasn't 100% opposed to it since I'm all for newer ways to experience games and or try them. But after trying PSNow whenever it first came out and it being totally unplayable experience for me (Wired PS4 connection and at least 100Mbs Down According to [fast.com](https://fast.com)). I have not tried it from a chrome cast ultra yet only on my personal desktop at home w/ the same connection as my PS4 and on my Laptop at work that has the same down speeds from testing but much less reliable due to it powering many devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the important things though instead of my previous experiences. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Setup** 

**FAST** Well for PC use, you sign into [stadia.google.com](https://stadia.google.com) with your google account enter your invite code you receive when you order the Founders Edition. Click on the game you want to play, let it run your connection test without even telling you, then you're in playing your games! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Gameplay** 

The main game I play is Destiny 2, I play it in my living room on my launch PS4 and my Desktop in my room. I haven't tried any other games yet and have around an hour or two in game on Stadia. Playing on PC with a mouse and keyboard, resulted in a tiny bit of input lag on my mouse controls for some reason. I am using a wireless mouse but also experienced this with a cheap HP Office mouse that was wired into my laptop at work. Overall the gameplay was much smoother than a controller, it had felt better than playing on my PS4 at home on my TV, possibly due to it playing at 60fps compared the wonky framerate of the game on console and it nearly being unplayable due to load times. Overall it FELT GREAT. No noticeable lag, a few minor drops. The only artifacting I had seen was when I was just starting the game. I have tried it on the two settings (4k Max quality and the Limited 720p quality). But I loved it and whenever I receive my chromecast ultra it will be replacing my living room gaming over my PS4 for playing Destiny or any other games that my PS4 won't play above 30fps. But not my desktop experience in my room (144hz monitor and above 60fps framerate). Also no downloading a game or waiting for an update is one of the most refreshing experiences I've had in a long time, even making my manager at work say ""Wow thats just fucking awesome"". But there weren't any major issues I've had so far playing on it and have absolutely loved it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Price** 

Currently the only way to play Stadia is by buying a $130 Founder Edition which comes with 3 months of Stadia Pro (Allowing 4k Gaming and a service that gives you games every month like PS+) it includes a Chromecast Ultra and Stadia Controller also (Of Course) I have not received either of these yet, as said in the beginning paragraph. I'm very excited to received these, whenever you look at the price you're paying for the founder edition you're receive a $70 chromecast ultra, $70 Stadia controller and 3 months of a pro membership which is $10 a month. You're getting it all for much cheaper than a current gen console IF YOU HAVE THE INTERNET FOR IT. Now you do not have to have Stadia pro to play games on it, once you purchase a game on it you have a bases membership that limits you to 1080p gaming. I don't find this as a big issue since you can literally play the game anywhere you have good internet, even on your phone. Overall I find it worth it currently if you're looking to game casually or for on the go, especially if you hate mobile games (just make sure you have an unlimted data plan.) Now its currently now out on all mobile devices only on Google's Pixel devices which is a major bummer to me as an IOS user, even if I wanted to play it on one of my previous android devices such as my OnePlus7 Pro. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I buy this now?** 

This is probably one the best questions about the Stadia, and simpley you have to ask yourself 

* Am I home 24/7 with a only way of gaming is a PC 

Then no I don't see this as worth it to you, now if you have a 4k Tv in your living room then possibly so you can play games on it without having to setup a current gen console that feels worse for certain games. It's definitely worth it for me. 

* Is my internet good enough? 

If it is and you want a device/service to replace your current console or just don't want to purchase one then spending $130 is easier for you then definitely get it. But don't ESPECIALLY if your internet isn't good enough. I really find this a great solution to casual gaming in bigger cities where having high speed internet shouldn't be an issue. 

* I already own every high end way of gaming why should I get it? 

You shouldn't I don't see this as an alternative to hardcore gaming or competitive gaming, google is marketing it very oddly and poorly which could be the downfall of it (I really hope they don't kill it off). It's not a good replacement yet for your current gen consoles due to the small game collection and possible issues you could have with your internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall** 

Personally I really enjoyed this service and will continue my Pro membership after the 3 month trial, I have no connection issues with it. I find this a great alternative especially down the pipeline of it to console gaming and or mobile gaming, my roommate was another great example of super casual gamer that will more than likely use this as an alternative to his current xbox. The gameplay, price and setup of this thing is just awesome if you're looking for multiple ways to enjoy your games, I am in an odd situation with games like Destiny 2 that I love and will play it anytime I possibly get the chance and being able to experience it on my living room TV will be amazing especially since it will be replacing my current PS4. I love this service and fully support the ideas behind but not the marketing. It's a solid experience and very refreshing to first encounter not having to update download or anything for games, its fucking great for that. Should you buy it? Yes, if you don't have a great way to play current games or in an odd situation like mine and if your internet holds up to it! No, if you only play games on your PC and or Xbox One X or PS4 Pro, it is replacing my launch PS4 though due to 60fps gameplay much much much faster load times. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; 

Its awesome if you have great internet and don't have room or want to play console games at 30fps, setup is easy, price isn't bad currently for what all you get, but also much more options are available later. You can wait for those if you want and don't feel like spending $130 for the current bundle option you can just buy the game you want and play or start a pro membership and play whatever you want. I love it, but Im in an odd situation that everyone possibly won't be in.

Recently however, I’ve fallen into the trap of MMO’s and the whole “battle pass” scheme. What I’m trying to say is, I can’t enjoy playing video games anymore unless I know I’ll be rewarded for it in game. Whether that means my game time will amount to a skin, emote, an exclusive weapon, etc etc. I feel like I’m wasting my time and it honestly sucks. 

I hate feeling this way and wish I could go back to enjoying a video game for the sake of having fun. It all seems like a job to me now. Currently I’m heavily invested in Destiny 2 and nothing against that game, I love it a lot, however now I feel as if I can’t break out of that mentality. In Destiny, my time is rewarded with XP, triumphs, rare weapon drops, skins in game, all of which I enjoy. However, after awhile that sort of gaming gets very exhausting and starts to feel like a job.

Games,"I'm stumbling the play store, but a lot of reviews look fake and it's hard to tell what's actually gonna be good and what games are locked behind pay walls. I'm willing to pay some money for the game, but I don't want a game that constantly requires me to put more money in to get progression going.

Anyway, I love games like the Chao World in Sonic Adventure 2 where breeding and raising the things are the central mechanic, but it's hard to find games like that for some reason. A lot of those games add a lot of unnecessary mini games that really just get in the way of what I personally want in the game, or they have absolutely no substance at all and nothing to do. Chao World was nice because the mini games were completely optional and were something to do with your higher lvl chaos; they weren't chores that didn't even utilize the things I was making so that I could get resources to continue playing the game, which seems to be the norm. 

I also really liked that in Chao World there was a lot of variation that could happen between different individuals, not just preset types that generically lvl up and evolve into the same thing no matter what. I guess I'd be more okay with that if there was a large enough list of things to breed where you had to get random bottom tier eggs or whatever and breed them into different combos to get the other stuff.

Games,"I’ve been writing about video games on the side for around two years now. It’s fun, and it’s challenging, and the tasks and responsibilities also help enrich my love for the hobby. How cool is that?

I’m also Filipino, and I guess you can say our culture — especially media portrayals or themes — can be quite different.

- For instance, one of our biggest box office stars is called “Vice Ganda,” a gay man who loves to dress in bombastic and flamboyant attires. He has “kilig” (romantic chills) moments with a show regular, a hunky dude.
- Showtime, a noontime show, has segments called “I am Pogay” (“pogi” = handsome, so it has handsome but gay contestants), “That’s my Tomboy,” and “Miss Q&amp;A.”
- Many TV shows, including a weekly drama show called “Maalaala Mo Kaya” (MMK) have protagonists and themes espousing the virtues of marginalized groups — those in poverty, those who aren’t as good-looking, those with disabilities or defects, indigenous people or those with darker skin, and more.
- Female protagonists, traditionally, also have backstories about how they’re maltreated, abused, or demeaned. Portrayals often have the “bida” (protagonist) as a demure, conservative girl-next-door type, and the overly-sexualized or seductive female actress is the villain.

Traditional Filipino media has viewers hooked and rooting for the underdog. Shows and segments present the trials that these people face and, in the end, they triumph against the odds.

Maybe it helps that most of my people live in poverty — which means that the stories of those who are demeaned, abused, discriminated, oppressed, and mistreated have become more relatable. “Art imitates life,” as they say — and this is true in TV shows, movies, and, yes, games.

————

In some ways, I can relate this to what I’ve seen in various western gaming discussions and controversies, things which I’ve hardly taken note of before.

As a Filipino gamer for 30+ years, my gaming circle is limited to friends in the real-world and random people I’ve met online (ie. WoW). There was never any inclination to pop in and out of various websites, forums, or subreddits to “see the culture” of the western gaming world, at least until I started covering games more actively.

There were gaming moments which did surprise me:

- If there’s an LGBT character, theme, or even an innocuous-looking flag on a desk, there are those who consider this automatically as “unnecessary” or “pandering.”
- If a woman isn’t overly sexualized or is relying on strong character types, it’s seen as “woke.”
- And, yes, if there’s representation for minorities or marginalized groups that have been discriminated against, there will be some who’d complain.
- That looming theme of a “culture war.”

These reactions surprised me because — even in my very imperfect country with some (admittedly) formulaic show plots and shallow storylines — the themes have become “normal.”

- Vice Ganda is gay, and some of Showtime’s segments have gays. = People are entertained.
- The poor, non-sexualized woman has to rely on her strong will to defeat a bad man. = “Ang galing mo, girl,” says a Filipino viewer.
- This character has darker skin and is bullied, harassed, and driven to desperation, only to become more determined to reach their dream = And people would be moved to tears by the story.

From the time Roderick Paulate started cross-dressing in 80s movies and when Nora Aunor showed her acting chops, it was ingrained in us that these characters were the “bidas.” Their stories are *our* stories, or at least experiences we could all relate to.

And I guess that’s why we’ve never seen that much backlash when it comes to the portrayal of LGBT or marginalized people in our media — a backlash wherein people feel these depictions don’t belong, or they’re just for the sake of “pandering” or “wokeness.”

We moved on and accepted that these media portrayals are just a way of the daily Filipino life, I guess. Meanwhile, I look at video games — interactive products and hobbies, things we’ve loved since we were kids — and it’s almost like a “political battleground” in the west.

Yes, I do find it weird at times.

I just thought I’d share. Cheers!",Writing about video games has helped me appreciate my country’s media portrayals (Filipino perspective)

Games,"Hi there, I'm just getting into collecting games over the past year and am missing a whole bunch of older games I missed as a kid. There aren't a lot of thrift stores in my area and they're inconsistent and don't get great games often, so I'm left wondering how I'm supposed to get these games, as GameStop (EB Games here in Canada) doesn't accept anything seventh gen or prior. Amazon is always an option and I've gotten a few games from them, but Amazon prices are always crazy high (LEGO Indiana Jones is over $30. At a thrift store it would be $3).

So I thought, there must be an online shopping website that's made with games in mind, with good prices and a wide selection of 6th and 7th gen titles. I've been looking around, but I can't find anything amazing, and I thought I'd turn to the community to see where actual collectors get their games from!

I don't need a case to be in perfect condition or anything, I just need it to not be torn/melted/etc, but I need art in my cases. So I don't need ""mint condition"" or anything like that. It's more about the games to me, but there is a degree of presentability I look for. The criteria for the ""best"" in this case would be A) fair prices, B) good shipping prices (free is amazing but I don't expect it, note I live in Canada so naturally the further away, the more it will cost), and C) good selection. I collect games from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, and some of the sites I've looked at are light on Microsoft or Nintendo games.

So I just got hit with a nostalgic view of me playing a PC game back when I was a kid, I played this game probably somewhere around 2003-2006. It's a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to get to the end of the level by clearing obstacles. You are playing as a character who can walk around, your screen doesnt move because the levels are not that big. The game is kinda like Portal but it's not POV, it's in a 3D perspective from an above POV. You have to be smart enough to pass the levels or you have to start over after messing up. I remember that there is an animation scene where the same race/kind of little guys with big round heads get hit by a tornado or something. I think the goal was to save everyone by completing the levels.

""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person mystery game focused on exploration and discovery. 
You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan’s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.
Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.
Still, the discoveries won’t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul’s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.""

&gt;I can’t recommend Forza Horizon 2 hard enough. If I could give it a 6/5 I would, it’s stunning to look at, the controls are tight, the sounds are soothing, and is just all around fun to play; it just hit all my happy spots. I’d have to say that this is my favorite game to date on the Xbox One. Is this worth your time, yes it is. Oh my goodness, yes it is.

&gt;Every element in Forza Horizon 2 adds up to an exceptional experience. The story isn't over the top so as to get in the way of racing, driving feels as good as it ever did in Forza Motorsport, there's a ton of things to do, and the game looks absolutely beautiful -- especially the long-awaited dynamic weather system. Forza Horizon 2 is a must-have on the Xbox One.

It isn’t just a game that brings immense satisfaction to car enthusiasts, it’s a highly enjoyable destination for anyone willing to buckle up behind a wheel.

&gt;The first Forza Horizon set a new standard for open-world racing games, and Forza Horizon 2 has comprehensively updated that standard. The location is right, the car list extensive, the handling nuanced but accessible, and the visuals are excellent. Above everything it’s always fun, whether you’re in a ludicrous Land Rover race or sniffing out a hidden Barn Find. Forza Horizon 2 is Test Drive Unlimited, PGR, Smuggler’s Run, and Forza Motorsport all crammed into a T-shirt cannon and fired into your face. It wears its inspiration on its sleeves but damn if that’s not a killer combination.

&gt;I’m not a huge car guy, but Forza Horizon 2 makes me realize that I am someone who loves driving. It combines all the best elements of car culture and empowers players to take and leave the things they enjoy. For example, it has deep tuning options for you mechanics. You can adjust the level of air in your tires if you want. And if you don’t, then don’t even think about it.

&gt;Playground games have once again met, and even exceeded, my expectations for Forza Horizon 2. The open world of southern Europe, rain or shine, not only provides a great backdrop, but it is an awesome automotive playground too (did you see what I did there?). With so much in-game content fans will find themselves racing for many days and nights (not just virtual) and the multiplayer modes add even more playtime for fans. If you are an Xbox One owner and looking for a racing game that is an open world, fun, and has a lot of replayability while being both accessible to beginners and a challenge racing veterans given the number of gameplay options, then you really shouldn’t look any further then Forza Horizon 2.

&gt;In many ways, it’s clear that Forza Horizon 2 is definitely bigger than the original. It’s a great racer in terms of gameplay and chock-full of content that could potentially keep you busy for months on end. But gutting the story—and taking away one of the key pillars that made the first Forza Horizon so special—to blur the line between single- and multiplayer left a sour taste in my mouth. If all you care about is getting behind the wheel and scenic European vistas, though, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better experience.

&gt;The excellent foundation below Forza Horizon 2's open world and the experimentation that it occasionally encourages at least provide a reason to race there.

We're now using battle.net 2.0 which is for games like SC2, wow, hearth stone

The accounts that were on battle.net 1.0 never were intended to merge over, and while we didn't take the servers down for the old games we no longer provide support for them


Rodburdel
at 16:33:38
Which means we don't have tools anymore to assist with any sort of account recovery

I just dont understand how you can still be selling a product that can apparently just disappear with no way of finding it on your end

at 16:39:31
The older games just get phased out as the new ones are put out. It happens with all games and sequels really, I do apologixe, but I have no control over the support.

Games,"As with all new titles, I approached this game with only the most rudimentary understanding of what it was – I don’t want to begin forming opinions until I’ve had the chance to try things first-hand.

I’m now [**halfway into the game**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWTxRITKTSQ) and am thus far unimpressed (you can find the first part [**here**]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsIyIjxeyAY)).

**A game or an art piece?**

James Beech, creator and former Crytek employee, has marketed the game as:

&gt;[[…] as a work of Art unique to this medium. […] I wanted to play up the aspects of an interactive, virtual environment in relation to story-telling.](http://visit-ultraworld.com/about-the-game/)

Unfortunately, in focussing on the ‘art’, James appears to have completely neglected the ‘story-telling’ aspect. Even the art isn’t that extraordinary: a series of basic shapes with flat primary colours, plus a few lighting effect options tagged on as rewards for progression but which serve zero purpose in the game itself.

**Narrative? What narrative?**

Far more disappointing than the visuals is the total lack of narrative depth. As you’ll see from the video, an AI NPC repeatedly poses the same series of solipsistic and existential questions: *‘what is true?’ ‘what is my purpose?’* 

Unfortunately, now about an hour into a two-hour game, these questions are yet to be developed or answered in any way.

I put this to James, who responded:

&gt; Without revealing the themes/intent of the piece, I will say that the ""lack of philosophical depth"" is quite intentional. […] Simplicity and timelessness were both goals I kept in mind for all aspects of production […] I was aiming for just the right amount of depth to get the overall points across without distracting from them.

I’ll let you make up your own minds, but of what I’ve played so far, this is yet to earn the [£10/$15 asking price](https://sites.fastspring.com/neonserpent/instant/ultraworld).

Other negatives have said it's horribly optimized, running sluggish and stuttering at times.

&gt; The problem with DriveClub is that it's just competent. You'll drive some fast cars in some arresting environments. You might even have fun, in between getting clobbered with penalties. But there's no romance to it. No passion. What there is, however, is the lingering sense that the gaps were supposed to be filled by the much-touted social features - the fires were to be stoked by human rivalry. Sadly, beyond those bite-sized Face Off challenges, which are essentially side missions, there's nothing particularly engaging or new here.
&gt; 
&gt; What we're left with is a flimsy framework - a sort of clothes horse for content - rather than a truly great racing game. DriveClub is patently intended to attract a global, interconnected audience of fiercely competitive racers but, to quote the increasingly obscure 1989 Kevin Costner film Field of Dreams: if you build it, they will come. And, unfortunately, Evolution hasn't quite built it.

&gt; DriveClub doesn't have any one element that makes it an incredible game or a huge leap forward for the racing genre, but it makes some smart choices underneath top-of-the-line presentation. And in embracing a social media-influenced setup to build enjoyable asynchronous multiplayer, it teaches a few important lessons other developers should learn from.
  
[Gamespot](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/driveclub-review/1900-6415900): 5  
  
&gt; In fact, it's hard to find any true celebration here. Driveclub is ordinary menus and ordinary races, standard time trials, and a few drift events. Driveclub is bland social competition. Driveclub is the fear of risks and the embrace of the ordinary. It's basic racing in basic packaging, beautiful and inert and full of attractive cars. It is not, however, an argument for a new generation of driving, given how it fails to exceed the standards of the old one.
  
[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review): 7.9  
  
&gt; Driveclub is the best-looking racing game I’ve ever seen on a console, but down deep it’s a more modest, conventional arcade racer than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today. While it successfully creates fast and fun races with a great sense of speed, the overly aggressive AI grates, the difficult drifting seems at odds with the accessible handling, and the single-player loses zest once the solo content runs dry. I’m also surprised at how partisan the day-one car list is. That said, the tentacles of Driveclub can grip tight if you get invested in the game’s asynchronous challenges, and it’s very much geared around encouraging us to hop online and compete by making it so easy.  
  
[Gameinformer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/driveclub/b/playstation4/archive/2014/10/07/game-informer-driveclub-review.aspx?utm_content=buffer815e6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer): 7.75  
  
&gt; DriveClub works as advertised, and despite the seamlessness of its single-player and online features, the game's not wildly more captivating than most other racers out there. It captures the spur of competitive racing, but this is due more to the fact that its racing fundamentals (which are more sim than arcade) give it a good foundation rather than some groundbreaking feature set. Drive it fast and drive it hard, but don't expect a miracle.  
  
[Videogamer](http://www.videogamer.com/reviews/driveclub_review.html): 8  
  
&gt; But even with its shortfalls there are few racers that manage to marry up the joy of driving with the thrill of competing against friends and strangers as successfully as this, which makes popping a score on the end of this review one of DriveClub's toughest challenges yet. I stayed up until the early hours of the morning one night frantically trying to beat a challenge set by another games site. They won. I lost. But the desperate desire to win – and the urge to silently brag about the victory – made the race deeply exciting.
&gt; 
&gt; And it's intense rivalries like this that lie at the heart of DriveClub. It's a game whose appeal lives and dies in its online time trials and sensational visuals, and whose sense of one-upmanship and competition is leaps above the rest of the pack.  
  
[Gamesradar](http://www.gamesradar.com/driveclub-review/): 4\5  
  
&gt; In fact, despite the concessions to accessibility, the number of times I was reminded of real cars while playing Driveclub is remarkable. I was constantly reminded of car journeys at Christmas, or the smell of a plush interior as you climb in, thanks to the detail with which Evolution has recreated every last component of the driving experience. The scenery, the motion, the different audio filters depending on which view you're using… all it needs is a packet of Werther's Originals to come with each copy and I think we're there. It's a strong racer. Just one with an identity crisis and a dependence on its net connection when it comes to delivering true fun.  
  
[Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2014/10/07/driveclub-review-the-stepford-drives/): 3\5  
  
&gt; Driveclub is a well-made, sometimes irritating juxtaposition of the old and new. The career mode is old-fashioned and its AI is hopelessly ignorant, but the graphics and competitive jabs online feel perfectly fit for 2014. Embracing your fellow human is key to overcoming Driveclub's faults, which ultimately make it a better staging ground for car-loving friends than an expression of automotive admiration itself.  
  
[USgamer](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/driveclub-ps4-review-): 3.5\5  
  
&gt; Basically, it's a smorgasbord of racing — as much as anyone could possibly consume. It works well, and the constant dynamic insertion of challenges into whatever race you're in helps make everything exciting and stimulating. Despite the occasional wobby handling, some rough edges, and tracks that aren't as exciting as they should be, DriveClub is still fun to drive. It's just a shame that it lacks any kind of feeling of reward or progression.  
  
[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-driveclub-281989.phtml): 7.5  
  
&gt; Driveclub is fast and easy to get into, nice to look at, and it has a lot going on in the background to keep you connected and competitive with your club members and other individuals. But that doesn't change the issues in the foreground. Its approachable and enjoyable racing is marred by AI cars that love to unfairly bash and crash on the single-player side. And bugs with the interface and the networking kept me from fully enjoying the multiplayer side. Beyond all of this, it feels like Driveclub needs more race and event types. What it offers has kept me going for a couple of weeks, but how much longer will it continue to do so?

[Hardcore Gamer](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/10/07/review-styx-master-of-shadows/110051/) - 4.5/5
&gt;Despite a few rough edges, Styx: Master of Shadows deserves a place alongside Metal Gear Solid 3, Hitman: Blood Money, and Mark of the Ninja as one of the best titles the genre has to offer.

[Entertainment Buddha](http://www.entertainmentbuddha.com/reviews/styx-master-of-shadows-review/) - 83/100
&gt;Styx: Master of Shadows does the stealth genre right, mixing tight mechanics with a diverse and unique selection of abilities with a wonderfully designed world. Fans of the genre rejoice, Styx is here to stay.

[Worlds Factory](http://www.worldsfactory.net/2014/10/07/styx-master-shadows-review-hit-miss) - 80/100
&gt;Styx: Master of Shadows has the potential to be a sleeper hit this year; it’s a deep and very well designed stealth game which is longer and more focused on stealth than a lot of other, full priced, AAA titles such as Hitman: Absolution or Thief.

[Dealspwn](http://www.dealspwn.com/styx-master-shadows-review-182535) - 6/10
&gt; Styx: Master Of Shadows is a proper old-school sneak'em up that harks back to the tough and rewarding heyday of the stealth genre, but the production values don't come close to matching the ambition.

Games,"I am a huge tech enthusiast, yet I cannot say that I am very much hardware savvy. I do understand that both the PS4 and the XBone have a very similar architecture to the PC one. Hell, I even hear that the Xbone will be getting Windows 10 upgrade, or at least some iteration of the new operating system from Redmond. PS4 has been running some sort of its own operating system, yet I am sure that it should not be that much difficult cracking it than the Xbone's (kinda)Windows platform.

So there is my question. Have both Sony and Microsoft actually made a mistake with approaching PC architecture in terms of potential piracy, or are these systems bulletproof for now? And if so, for how long?

I'm just looking for someone who knows this stuff inside out, just to shed some light on the topic and enlighten me, and I am sure many of our fellow redditors. 

Thanks!","Hacking and modding community has managed to hack into previous gen consoles and create an entire pirating culture around them. With the new consoles being very similar to PC in architecture, should we expect this hacking process to be even easier and more probable than ever?"
Games,"I'm getting increasingly worried about this game. 

Due to the director and the setting, I've been looking forward to The Evil Within for over a year, but alarm bells started ringing when it was announced that it uses the id tech 5 engine and was going to be locked at 30fps on the console. Arbitrary FPS locks are bad enough, but I was reading neogaf earlier today and someone had been speaking to one of the senior producers at Bethesda and [he's being incredibly cagey about what framerate the Evil Within will be on the PC](https://i.imgur.com/SBGnUEG.png).

It's bad enough using ridiculous PR quotes like 30fps ""makes more sense for survival horror"" (it doesn't) or that FPS doesn't matter for third-person games (it does), but he's being outright evasive about the performance of the game. 

It's less than a week until release. Maybe it will have a 60fps option (still not ideal, as unlocked FPS is far better... but this is id tech 5 we're talking about) but I urge people to reconsider their pre-orders until Bethesda clarify exactly what is going on here. I am personally of the belief that locked 30fps is NOT acceptable for the PC market in 2014 and it does NOT make the game ""more cinematic"" or ""more sense"" or the million other PR buzzwords they like to throw about to compensate for not being able to reach higher framerates.",Less than a week to go until The Evil Within's release date and we still don't know what FPS it will be on PC
Games,"Late game combat become more of a chore than a challenge and that can be true. But late game combat can be fun too sometimes if you make it hard.

[Take this](http://imgur.com/HxNrWox) for instance. Ignore the crippling weakness to burning which makes it so if you have either wraith power you can make him flee (which lets you grab with no resistance). If you find a powerful guy, give him a death threat you can easily get him up to power level 20. At this point sometimes these guys are about immune to everything. This guy can't be damaged with melee (including OP unlimited finishers), ranged, or stealth attacks. He even has monster slayer so you can't kill him off with them Caragors either. a

Actually if it wasn't due to the fact he is weak to fire this guy would actually be immortal (I suppose you could kite him around forever into explosives but they can be immune to that too). 

I'm having a blast just goofing off powering up everyone and seeing how many level 20 captains I can fight off at once in the middle of a base with letting the signals get lit. It can even be a bit challenging if they all have combat master to figure out ways of killing or terrifying them. 

If you don't find their weakness sometimes fighting these guys with 3-4 immunities feels impossible. Thankfully so far the game has always left a weak spot for them, usually something to terrify them or weak to a stealth finisher and the likes.

TL;DR

Games,"The [Nexus Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Player) set-top box has me excited. Here's why.

#x86 CPU

The Nexus Player has an [Intel Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(system_on_chip\)) processor. All Atom CPUs are x86. Developers have been writing for x86 for [decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86). Every game on Steam is x86 (or x86-64, ""64-bit""). The PS4 and Xbox One are x86.

PC game developers interested in porting their games to the Nexus Player only have to worry about the performance of the CPU (i.e., it's never going to run Crysis). Porting to a non-x86 architecture, normally a concern on Android, isn't a concern here. Nearly every Android device has an ARM CPU, which partially explains why lightweight games like [Nidhogg](http://store.steampowered.com/app/94400/) don't always make it to Android.

#Bluetooth and Micro USB

The Nexus Player has Bluetooth support. Do you have any Wii Remotes, Dualshock 3s, or Dualshock 4s lying around? All of those connect via Bluetooth. People have been connecting DualShock 3s to their Android phones for years. There are plenty of lesser-known Bluetooth devices, too. There's probably a game controller out there that supports Bluetooth and meets your needs.

Need more options? The Nexus Player has one micro-USB port. With a hub [like this](http://usb.brando.com/microusb-otg-4-port-hub_p03269c039d015.html), you can plug in extra controllers and USB hard drives.

#$100 – And someone’s taking a hit to their profits to make it happen

The cheapest suggested PC on [Logical Increments](http://www.logicalincrements.com/) is $214, and you have to assemble it yourself. No matter how easy it is to build a PC, most people will never try. These people are console gamers. They’re never going to plug in the family computer to their living room TV. Their current prebuilt desktops and laptops might even be less powerful than the Nexus Player, depending on how old their computers are and how expensive the computers were when they were new.

A $100 x86 PC would be a great way to introduce people to PC gaming, especially for getting people to see that PC gaming doesn't have to happen at a desk. The value offered by this device is crazy. An internet commenter theorizes that Intel is giving Google a great deal on their Atom processors, because ARM has a stronghold on Android devices. (Amazon’s recent Fire TV is quite similar to the Nexus Player, but it runs on an ARM chip.)

The cheapest Chromebox, also made by Google, is $140 with probably a faster processor and definitely more USB ports. That's nothing new; in PC gaming, if you spend more you can get a better computer.

On top of Intel sacrificing profits, Google might be doing the same. Google is hoping Nexus Player owners are more likely to rent movies from Google Play or watch ads on YouTube, and they're willing to get the price as low as possible to make that happen.

#(Hopefully) compatible with custom operating systems

The Nexus Player is part of Google’s Nexus line of smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes. The [Nexus 5](http://www.androidcentral.com/unlocking-nexus-5-bootloader) phone can be “unlocked” to install non-Google-approved operating systems. So can the [Nexus 7](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2379618) tablet. The [Nexus Q](http://www.android.gs/unlock-root-google-nexus-q/) set-top box, a 2012 device closely comparable to the Nexus Player, can also be unlocked. To date, all of Google’s Nexus devices can be customized in this way.

This is huge. If the Nexus Player continues the trend, other x86 operating systems will be able to be installed on the device. If so, I guarantee some variation of Linux will be made to work with the Nexus Player. Steam OS might also be made to run on the device. Even if not, something like Ubuntu can be made to run Steam, so whether or not Steam OS makes it to the Nexus Player is of little concern.

#My plans

If the Nexus Player can run Linux, *I’m buying one*. Linux support brings Steam support, which brings a convenient way to run games I actually enjoy playing.

I live away from home for most of the year. I have a great gaming computer. Sometimes I go home for a few days, and I don’t lug my computer home each time. I can’t afford to build a duplicate PC and just leave it at home. But I think I can afford a $100 computer. It will probably be able to run [Awesomenauts](http://store.steampowered.com/app/204300) - our 6-year-old family computer can, so I'm comfortable with that assumption.

When I’m home for the summer, I keep my gaming PC away from the biggest TV in the house. If the Nexus Player is able to run fast-paced 2D games like Nidhogg (no Linux port yet, argh!) and use Steam In-Home Streaming for occasional big-screen sessions with Far Cry 3 and Saints Row 4, it will be great. Nidhogg is awesome, but I’m not moving my PC to my TV every time my friends come over. There are too many cables I have to unplug and rewire.

Most of the time, if I’m running emulators, I’ll do it on my gaming PC, but there might be a time I’d like to run a Game Boy Advance or Super Nintendo game on a big TV.

Part of the value of the Nexus Player for me, since I already have a gaming PC, is that I don’t yet have a good set-top-box for playing movies. But this post is solely about the Nexus Player’s gaming features. For those who already have a gaming PC and are not interested in streaming, this may not be a good choice.

If this Linux thing works out, and the [processor](http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?p=36803709#3257) is powerful enough to play a decent number of [good games](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=&amp;sort_by=_ASC&amp;os=linux&amp;page=1#sort_by=Reviews_DESC&amp;os=linux&amp;page=1), I'm going to highly recommend that my non-PC gaming friends get one.",Google's Nexus Player has great prospects for gaming.

Games,"To those who have played it, what do you think?

Personally I'd describe my experience with it as refreshing. Not only are its gameplay mechanics very original but the art style and humor is something I haven't seen in awhile.

The game Im looking forward to the most from this generation is Crackdown 3, and this game totally fulfills that itch. Jumping across the city building to building is not only incredibly fluid and easy to grasp, but just fun.

The combat is both varied and fast paced, you have to constantly be planning your next grind, bounce, or dash. All while actively killing enemies, dodge projectiles, and keeping your combo meter from falling.

The Art Style is any punk lovers dream come true. Quite often while playing the game I have these Deja-vu moments of me playing Tony Hawk as a kid. The music is top notch, the characters designs are unique, and the customization options are abundant.

Not to mention the enemy visual design is the best I've seen in years. Every single enemy I've fought is pleasant to look at. (Especially the Poppers)

The game is just fun.

Its the first game of this generation to not be disappointing to me, that being said its not perfect.
Lack of true free-roam multiplayer is something that stops this game from being a 5/5 instead of a 4/5, sometimes the challenges aren't too fun, and the track selection tends to repeat itself.

Games,"**Spoilers Ahead**

Bayonetta 2 has been out nearly a week and I've beaten the story, now I'm going back and picking up stuff I missed and unlocking more stuff while trying out the higher difficulties.

I like this game a whole lot. It's non-stop spectacle, so much that I found myself putting the game down for a day or two  just to take in all the nonsense that had just occurred. Quad wielding chainsaws and being able to skate around on them required that I stop for a moment.

Like Bayo 1, it's finely tuned, controls well, and is a joy to play. It's the apex of this genre. Fun as hell and one of the finest action games I have ever played and a contender for the best game I have played all year. 

If you're not a fan of the previous game or this genre in general, Bayo 2 won't do anything to change that. But it does offer the same zany over-the-top spectacle from the first game and more. It's a great WiiU game and I'm glad Nintendo made it possible.

If there were anything I'd knock the game for is that the new characters aren't all that great and the boss fights aren't as completely insane as the first game, but they're still kind of insane. Some of the weapons feel kinda useless in comparison to the others (The bow comes to mind) but this was also an issue in the first, you can't win em all but I can imagine that people will find a way to mix and match said weapons so they feel more viable. Then again, min/maxing isn't really what these games are about so maybe that's not an issue at all. 

Overall I think it's terrific. I really hope they make another one.

What do you guys think of it?


",Bayonetta 2: Thoughts?
Games,"I just want to add my opinion considerating all the hate right now about the announcement of Destiny's DLC.

Well, I don't participate in the beta. I was still playing Diablo 3 on my X1 when Destiny came out. To be honest, I wasn't even really waiting for that particular game. I don't want to be misunderstood here : i know there was really high expectation for this title and a lot of you were waiting for this game and I was instead waiting a lot for Horizon 2.

Well, some weeks later, I finally pick up Destiny mid-october. Right now, I only played 22 hours, taking my time to explore and do the campaign mission. I know it may feel weird for you : but I really have the feeling that this game was my first true next-gen experience. Everything is smooth and looking good. I love the character creation, inventory management, 3rd person view

Now, i'm 22 hours in the game and only level 19. And with the raid and strike mission, I have the feeling that there's a lot more to do.I only played the Nexus strike mission with 2 other guys and that was a whole lot of fun. We where maybe really bad, I don't know but we had to start again 3 times to finally beat the boss. And it was really cool to join after together as a team and doing some patrol mission...

That's it. Maybe it will help someone to decide if he should give a try on this game. It was a really great surprise for me and even if I put only another 20 hours or so, I really have to feeling that I got a lot more fun than I was expecting.
",My experience with Destiny
Games,"I spent several hours with Hatoful Boyfriend last night and I seriously need to get something off my chest. This game came out with minimal fanfare last month, a remake of a Japanese dating sim from a few years ago. The main draw, of course, was that the characters in the game were all birds except for the protagonist, who is a human girl and the only human student at this prestigious St. PigeonNation high school.

It made the rounds of Twitch.tv and YouTube for a little bit, as expected, with people having a laugh at the goofy and outlandish premise, but I have not heard any discussion of it at all in mainstream games media since then. 

I picked it up on launch day and have been playing it on and off over the last few weeks. Honestly, I enjoyed how honest and sweet the entire thing was. It had a subtle way of dropping hints about a slightly darker story of a post-apocalyptic world behind the sweet, innocent main story, much in the way that a lot of Adventure Time fans praise that show. I was making a point to go down the list of achievements and collect all of the different endings. 

Last night, having gotten 50% of the achievements, I fired up the game with the aim of quickly getting Sakuya's extended ending when the game did something that it had never done before. It asked me if I wished to play a normal semester or if I wanted to ""Fulfill a promise from long ago?"" Obviously I chose the latter and the game continued on more or less like it normally would.

**And then at the start of the second semester my character was found dead and hacked to pieces and a gigantic dome descended upon the school, trapping all of the birds inside.** Mouth agape, I was on a multi-hour long murder mystery, now playing the role of Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove that was a childhood friend of the former protagonist, trying to get to the bottom of this grisly murder.

My neck still hurts from the whiplash of that sudden change. Keep in mind, I had put about 6 or 7 hours into the game so far and had *no* idea what was going on. It felt wrong. It felt like I was living one of those creepypastas where the game is haunted and shows you things that you are not supposed to see. It went into incredible detail about the past wars between birds and humans and several conspiracies featuring biological warfare that would have put Resident Evil to shame.

I have never, ever had an experience like this with any game before and I think it is *saintly* of the Hatoful Boyfriend community to keep this a secret from the gaming public at large. Being ripped out of the comfort zone and dropped into something so alien and horrifying was one of the most satisfying and mystifying experiences that I have ever had in gaming. 

The last time that I felt more affection or familiarity with a cast of fictional characters was Mass Effect. This is a very similar feeling. Sakuya, Ryouta, Yuuya... all of us have been through some *shit* together. And this was a pigeon dating game..?

Anyone else that has played this game, did you know what you were getting into? Was your experience similar? Can anyone think of another game that buried the lead so deeply that the majority of players may not ever find out that it actually exists?",Can we talk about Hatoful Boyfriend...? (Serious Spoilers)

So Persona 4 is this one little JRPG that became one of the best in it's genre beating ""Rogue Galaxy"", ""Ar tonelico"", ""Atelier Iris"", ""Odin Sphere"", ""Shining ..."" etc. and standing on the top of the list along with ""Final Fantasy"", ""Tales of ..."" and others. Persona 4 Golden, currently standing on the top of the list and being the best PS Vita game ever (according to [metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available/vita/metascore)) So I decided to play it and was not disappointed. Overall a great game.

Atelier Iris. I got this game back when I was 7 years old, and I was extremely happy by the time. I've been the only boy in school whose go-to game was not some ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" or ""Warcraft III"", I was just a little Atelier Iris fan, and this game is what got me into the RPG genre. Dark Cloud, Ar tonelico, Persona, Metal Saga, hell, even The Elder Scrolls!

I've completed Persona 4 relatively recently, and I call it extremely worth, it made me a better person (lol game teaches me how to live, I think I have a problem) overall and I did not regret a single second playing it (well, with an exception of [Shadow Yukiko](http://reddit.com/spoiler) damn, that battle was hard). And after a few hours later, I decided to play some good ol' ""Mana Khemia"" which kinda made me thinking... What if ""Persona"" games are in the same universe as the ""Atelier"" games?

For those of you unaware, ""Atelier"" franchise is about other universe where certain people called alchemists create various things with help of their magic companions called ""Mana"". There are various types of ""Mana"" that control various elements. From the most prime ones (Fire, Water, Wind, Lightning) to the most complicated ones (Growth, Fear, Smell, Power). To create those ""things"" I was talking about before you have to make a ""pact"" (AKA contract) with a Mana of certain elements. For example, to create a bomb using alchemy you'll need to have a pact with Fire mana. To create a revive elixir, you'll need to make a pact with Life mana etc.

First of all, let me break down why ""Persona"" and ""Atelier"" franchises are so similar. In Persona franchise you get to play as a certain ""protagonist"" which just so happens to get some adventures up his ass, solving murder cases, finding new friends etc. In Atelier franchise you also get to some adventures up your ass, but with less murders and friends, but more adventures. Sounds pretty cliche, but let's just roll with it for now.

In Persona franchise you play as a protagonist that finds a lot of friends in his adventures. In Atelier franchise main character also finds a lot of friends during his adventures. However this can be said to a lot more other RPGs so lets go in deeper...

In Persona franchise you have certain ""Social Links"" that show your relationships with certain people. You can upgrade them by hanging out with respective people, helping them, eating with them, playing with them... basically anything that would get you friends IRL. And by upgrading social links you are getting bonuses from the ""Arcana"" that this ""Social Link"" represents.

Greatest similarity of this in ""Atelier"" franchise is represented in ""Mana Khemia: the Alchemists of Al-revis"". Main protagonist there also has to be close friends with his fellow party members, otherwise you'll get a bad ending. This is not the best example of ""bonuses"" from upgraded social links, so lets go further.

In ""Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana"" shopkeepers ask you to complete certain quests like ""bring me that flower"", ""get me this book"", ""tell me how to make bread crumbs"" to make their shop diversity bigger, and just become overall closer. That's quite a bonus.

Ok, just being friends with someone to have some bonuses isn't enough of a connection, but it's still something. Second connection: Manas, Personas.

In Persona franchise every party member has his own ""persona"" which they get upon facing their ""true self"". However they can have only one ""persona"" per person due to not being open enough to people (?). Personas themselves are one of the only strengths of their wielders, especially in ""shadow"" world. Personas are basically spellbooks of their wielder, they can do all kinds of magic tricks as long as they know how to do them. The main protagonist has way lower restrictions about wielding personas, as he can wield up to 12 personas, as long as he's experienced enough.

In ""Atelier"" franchise, your party members are usually bonded to only one Mana, or are not bonded to one whatsoever. Example of Mana-using party member would be Iris from ""Atelier Iris 3: Grand Fantasm"" whose almost all abilities are dependent on manas who you've made a pact with. The example of NON Mana-using party member would be Vayne from ""Mana Khemia"" who of course has his little cat, but it's not a mana so it doesn't count. In ""Atelier Iris"" series their respective protagonists (Klein, Viese and Iris) don't have any restrictions upon how many manas to make pact with, while in Mana Khemia party members have only 1 Mana who they made a pact with, and in Mana Khemia 2 Manas just lost their relevance (Almost no manas are being used except for Yun and Whim.)

That's quite something. Third connection: Shadows. In Persona, a person must accept his hidden thoughts, that they are trying to deny, hide from everyone. In Mana Khemia, we have this guy called Roxis, who doesn't have a Mana since the beginning of the game, and therefore a rival of Protagonist's party, due to them having Manas and being stronger than him. However later in the game [He joins the protagonist's party as a party member, except he can't really do anything until he has Mana](http://reddit.com/spoiler) And if you decide to be friends with him, he'll reject you, and just won't want to talk with you at all (the dude's jelly, not his fault that I'm too good) But after continuous tries, you'll see the mana that Roxis's been trying to make a pact with. After talking with it, Mana decides that to agree to make a pact with Roxis he'll need to [Shake hands with protagonist with a sincere smile on his face.](http://reddit.com/spoiler). He doesn't want to agree at first, but later he'll just go ""aww screw it"" and do what Mana told him to. He beat his hatred to a certain person that hated the most, which requires a lot of strength. If that's not good enough for you, here's another one... (a shit ton of spoiler inc. prepare yourselves) Final boss.

The Final Boss in Mana Khemia is [Protagonists other self. That is created out of his true feelings.](http://reddit.com/spoiler) and during that battle the [Protagonist](http://reddit.com/spoiler) is unconscious and is unable to take part in the battle. See where this is going? In ""Persona"" the ""Shadow"" of a person also knocks it's ""Owner"" unconscious and they can't take a part in the battle no matter what. And if you defeat the final boss in Mana Khemia you either get a bad ending or just keep on fighting, BUT this time with [Protagonist](http://reddit.com/spoiler). In Persona 4 during [Shadow Rise](http://reddit.com/spoiler) battle [Rise](http://reddit.com/spoiler) can't be the part of it due to known reasons, however after you beat it [she](http://reddit.com/spoiler) can take a part in battle with [Shadow Teddie](http://reddit.com/spoiler) that comes in right after you beat [Shadow Rise](http://reddit.com/spoiler). Do you see the pattern? Let's go even deeper...

If you've played PS2 games of ""Atelier"" series, you'll notice that the timeline goes like this:

""Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny"" ---&gt; ""Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana"" ---&gt; ""Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm"" ---&gt; ""Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-revis"" ---&gt; ""Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy""

If you've played all the games that I just listed you'll see that time by time Manas lose their relevance and in the end, just become more of human-ish. Greatest example of ""humanisation"" would be [Yun](http://atelier.wikia.com/wiki/Yun) from Mana Khemia 2 which is a Fire Mana. [Uru](http://atelier.wikia.com/wiki/Uru) is also a Fire Mana that appears in Atelier Iris and Atelier Iris 2. Do you see the difference? Let's talk about ""relevance"" of Mana now.

In Atelier franchise Mana always were one of the most important aspects of the game, along with alchemy. However as the time goes by (and I mean in chronological order, not release order) Mana lose their relevance and impact on the game.

""Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny"" ---&gt; Mana are a must-have to create some items, and there are a LOT of Mana/Alchemy items. (Mana items are consumables while Alchemy items are equipment items). Elemental Crafting, you can create any Mana item that you've created already, as long as you have needed elements. Very important item: Aroma Material, gives a lot Health Regen, and overall very strong battle characteristics.

""Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana"" ---&gt; Much less Mana items, no Alchemy items at all, Manas themselves are used more to help you out during dungeon exploration, but Element Crafting is still there and also now you can equip your party members with Manas to give them various stat bonuses so Manas are still relevant. Aroma Material: still pretty important, but has much less impact (can't equip it on party members, but can equip it on Manas to transform them into other Manas).

""Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm"" ---&gt; Manas no longer needed while creating new items, now all you need is recipe, and Mana equipping now works differently. Now depending on which Mana you equip your character gains/loses several characteristics. But then again, you can easily work your way through the game without extra Mana help. Element Crafting is gone. Aroma Material is nearly useless, gives almost no useful combat stats.

""Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-revis"" ---&gt; Manas are still not needed, almost no Manas that you can make a pact with, and there are a lot of Manas that are aggressive and will try to kill you. Element Crafting is still gone. Aroma Material now can be easily created while before it was extremely rare. Still no useful combat stats, but now is used in regular crafting. One of the most important items in the franchise loses it's relevance :O.

""Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy"" ---&gt; Manas are now your party members! And you don't even need a pact with them! Only one Mana in the whole game that you can make a pact with (and it already has a pact with your fellow party member)! Still no Elemental Crafting, Aroma Material even more useless, Manas are more aggressive to humans [I mean duh, the final boss is Mana of Light](http://reddit.com/spoiler)

Over the time, Manas are becoming less of ""buddy"" type and more of ""worker"" or ""killer"" type. In Persona franchise Shadows literally want to kill you. And considering that the difference in the timeline of Persona franchise and Atelier franchise is arguably ~400 years (no technology, swords, rapiers, crossbows, very primitive rifles, [hidden blades](http://i.imgur.com/7y62NXQ.jpg)) it is very possible that Manas decided to go berserk and kill everyone they see. But how could they mutate so fast and just be trapped in this other dimension when they were obviously living together? The answer to this lies in Mana Khemia.

In Mana Khemia, when you complete whole game, a ""New Game+"" opens which allows you to play through the game again, but with the same characteristics that you had at the end of your first playthrough. And after you complete 8th chapter a new dungeon opens up, at the end of the Old Schoolhouse, behind the door that was locked during the first playthrough, and you had no way of opening it before. Behind this door lies the ""Bonus Dungeon"" where a lot of very strong monsters appear that have form of regular monsters from the outside, but with much higher armor and damage. And there's also a chance of you fighting with some other schoolers, just like you. But they're different... They never appeared in the game, they are just there, in this bonus dungeon. Could it be that those kids are not the schoolers themselves, but their ""other"" selves? This theory is supported by the Final Boss of the game, which is like I said before is [the other self of our protagonist](http://reddit.com/spoiler). It's also said that they're schoolers from the Old School, but that school was destroyed for a while ago, which would mean that they would be either dead, or extremely old by the time. Shadows apparently don't get older as hinted in Persona 4 The Animation. Also in Atelier Iris 3 there was this guy named [Crowley](http://reddit.com/spoiler) that had immense power of darkness and could single handedly destroy the world, but it was tough as the protagonist's party appeared as an obstacle, so he decided to give his power to other people who hated protagonist's party as well. After defeating all of them one of them deceased, and the other two just went missing until the end of the game, and [Crowley himself](http://reddit.com/spoiler) just disappeared. In Mana Khemia in the Bonus Dungeon, at the end of each floor you'll encounter a certain ""boss"". These bosses are the people that [Crowley](http://reddit.com/spoiler) gave power to and in the end, [himself](http://reddit.com/spoiler), but in distorted, dark form, being much stronger than they were in Atelier Iris 3. They don't talk, they don't care, they just kill. No emotions shown, just beating you to death. Oh and if it's not enough of a proof, sprites are darkened compared to Atelier Iris 3. In Persona 4, Shadows of their respective owners are covered with dark blue fog.

Also, in the Bonus Dungeon you can find several materials that are extremely rare, and don't appear in the normal world, and also give you very huge advantage. In Persona 4 during rainy days you can find ""Rain"" Shadows, that also can drop extremely rare drop that can be turned into a very strong equipment. Could this mean that the Midnight Channel in Persona 4 and the Tartarus in Persona 3 are the same places as Mana Khemia's Bonus Dungeon? And Shadows and Personas are just Manas that had enough of humans terrorizing them (Whim from Mana Khemia 2 is a perfect example of fis) and Manas that are still loyal to humans? Maybe. But that's just a theory.

****

**TL;DR** Atelier franchise is in the same universe as Persona franchise, Manas are Personas/Shadows and Bonus Dungeon from Mana Khemia is Midnight Channel from Persona 4 and Tartarus from Persona 3.","Is ""Persona"" franchise in the same universe as ""Atelier"" franchise?"

""Inquisition's characters and world, on the other hand, recall the grand gestures of the original Dragon Age, even though the game as a whole is so structurally different to its predecessors. It offers the thrill of discovery and the passion of camaraderie. It features a glee club called The Sing-Quisition, and a dwarf with writer's block. It establishes connections with its world in big ways and small, with the sight of a titanous temple and the smirk of an Orlesian commander in love. Dragon Age: Inquisition is a wonderful game and a lengthy pilgrimage to a magical world with vital thematic ties to one we already know.""

&gt;One of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.

Games,"So everywhere I read, I hear that the Xbone and PS4 are already hitting performance walls, and there isn't that much optimization they can do like last gen because it is x86 and everyone knows how to work with that well already.  But they are still many magnitudes of power ahead of last gen, and yet games don't look that much better that run on both.  They might have a slightly higher resolution, or more detailed textures, but they don't look too terribly worse on last gen.  Yes they are only equal to a mid/low end PC, but that is still far ahead of last gen.  So why hasn't there been at list a bit bigger leap of graphics?  Or are their drivers/APIs that will allow games to look better over the years?  

I hope this doesn't come off as usual whining about how powerful the consoles are, because it's not.  I am genuinely curious about how hardware many magnitudes better only looks like an average leap in graphical fidelity.  I am not bashing devs/sony/ms here.  Shouldn't people be happy that consoles are 8x more powerful than the previous gen?

Games," I've been gaming since my early child hood and have enjoyed the industry grow each and every year but this year seems like quite a dud. Both triple A and indie game developers are pumping more games than ever but I can help but find any good games with story at the forefront this year. Last year we had games like Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite from the big publishers and games like Gone Home and Brothers for the indie side of things.

What about you guys and gals?  Do you even read reviews or do you just ignore them? Or do you criticize the writers?

If you read my article, I talk about how reviews are more personal than they are overall scores yet they're treated as overall scores.  Why have they deviated so far from score to personal feeling about the game?

Games,"Hey guys, I love playing stuff from Telltale. The stories are great and always full of surprises. I do, however, have one issue--they run extremely poorly. 

I played The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us on 360 and they didn't run well. Textures came in blurry, animations were always jerky, etc. The biggest problem was how many times the framerate dropped or the game jittered, especially during action scenes. I honestly don't think that I've ever seen a smooth transition to action in a Telltale game. 

I originally thought ""okay, the hardware is ageing, this can be expected."" Even though the game didn't seem like it could be too taxing on the hardware. However, when I got The Wolf Among Us on the Xbox one, I still experienced these problems. They were a better, but still very noticeable. 

In my opinion there is no excuse for this. Telltale games don't push the envelope from a graphics standpoint, there don't seem to be any complex A.I. systems or anything like that at work. The game is a point and click adventure with some QTEs in it. It should run much better than it does. What do you guys think? Is there something behind the scenes that it extremely taxing on the systems that I don't know about? Is there an excuse for the way Telltale games run?

**TL;DR:** I think that Telltale games run extremely poorly and that there is no excuse for it. What do you guys think?","Let's talk about Telltale games, and how they run."

I am currently still purchasing my games on my PS3 and I know there are still lots of people out there buying all the new releases on xbox360 and PS3 yet there is no coverage of the ports on any of the big gaming news sites. 

Destiny on PS3: Runs perfect, graphics look amazing, and I have never seen any glitches. I don't think there is a single feature that wasn't included in this version. 

Advanced Warfare on PS3: Runs good for the most part, I have had a few loading glitches and freezing, but nothing that breaks it. The graphics look just as good as any of the previous CoDs. The menus take a bit of loading but other than that it's a solid version.

Games,"I'm 23 and I've played a lot of 4X games, they're probably my favorite genre, I love the expanding, researching, interacting with players/ai and occasionally RPing a certain race/culture.

Thing is, having played a lot of them I can't help but notice that they all tend to have a rather big problem. When you get past a certain point (pretty much when the ""expand"" phase properly ends and everyone is set in their spots) they all become pretty dull. Unless you're at a real starting disatvantage or made some seriously bad calls, you're usually in a pretty good spot (if you know what you're doing) and have a pretty decent hold on your little corner of space/ground/whatever.

Now against players this usually means that there are the guys with an advantage and the ones without one. Alliances are made and unless someone is vastly superior to the other players (both in actual skill and in the in-game position) the game can drag on for a while. But the outcome might not be entirely set in stone, and small tricks might have big impact.

But agains AI it usually means one thing. You are going to win somewhere in the next 150-200 turns. Plain and simple, Nothing exciting or interesting is really going to happen in the time from here to there. You'll get some better tech, you'll probably get bored with micromanaging cities/planets and just fill up the queue, your standing armies will either be good enough, retrofittable, or easily expandable. Unless you're going for the ""destroy everyone"" victory condition you'll just be sitting there producing whatever it is you need to be producing to win.

This is insanely boring.

And the worst part is I don't know how to ""fix"" this problem. Obviously for a player like me the expansion, and early exploitation of resources/weaknesses is the fun part, but I don't want to just restart the game after I'm past this point.

Big part of the problem seems to be the fact that in 4x games nobody can REALLY take a punch. Because you're playing simulated big empires on what actually turns out to be a micro scale. Military action is almost always the best way to solve your problems. And except for the RP games you rarely ever end a war with just taking a single city, or beating the enemy into submission forcing him to pay reparations and than maintaining the status quo.

It just doesn't happen. Everyone has one maybe two major armies, they throw them at each other. And the winner takes literally everything. 

I think that if we managed to think of a way that would make war a more drawn out and meticulous process, it would force the players to engage in more acts of politics further down the game. If you have multiple empires of roguly equal power, they will mostly strive to maintain a status quo. Take a colony here, a major resource there, but they won't really let one empire take another because than they'll have an opponent far more powerful than either of them can face.

If there was a good mechanical way to enforce this (and the only game i can think of that even tried to do it was Galactic Empires 2 and it didn't do a great job of it) I think it could really reinforce the late game of most 4x games.

&gt;Though both games contain massive amounts of content, they're also accessible enough that you can enjoy playing only in a few minutes.

Furthermore, since the development team had never worked on a Smash Bros. game previously, we started the project basically from Zero.

&gt;On a personal note, during development I cast aside almost everything in my private life, immersing myself in my work. I took no time off, and there were days when I went home only to sleep then return to work again. Indeed, I overdid it and nearly fell apart.

&gt;But I'm happy to say we did all this for one person: the player.

&gt;Also, I should mention that without the efforts of the development team and the staff at Nintendo, we could never have put so much content into these games.

Games,"**If you've ever played Final Fantasy Tactics (FFT), or pretty much any other RPG, you've had a chance to shape your characters into your exact specifications - ready and fit for your chosen style of battle.**

FFT had a huge number of classes (jobs) and skills (abilities), that you could mix and match to make your dream character - resulting in things like Black/Time Mages and Ninja/Healers.

FFT is just one example though; 

A friend of mine was taken by the idea of an 'astrologer' class that could use different constellations as a type of magic (a class not present in FFT, but would have sold her on the game if it was).

Another friend mentioned that other games had 'machine' character types; These characters had no 'mana' but as a replacement their health naturally regenerated slowly over time (PSO I think?).

This really got me thinking to what class my perfect character would be, what traits they would possess, and what skills they would have - in a tactical battle setting (similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, Front Mission and many other great games).

Games,"I've spent the last couple of days playing The Crew, and I'm currently level 30ish.

I have to say, I'm loving every minute. Originally The Crew wasn't even on my radar, it looked interesting enough from what they announced, but I was probably going to give it a miss. But then I got into the Beta and I fell in love with the game.

This really hasn't been like any of Ubisoft's releases to date. It released without issues, it downloaded without issues, and I've been able to play without issues for a few days.

I love these kind of Racing RPG type games, I loved the oldschool Need For Speed games, and this is like those only massively expanded. For one thing, the open world is absolutely *massive*. I remember when I was playing during the beta with a buddy of mine, we'd reached the limits of what we could do in the beta so we decided to drive from one corner of the country to the other. It took us well over an hour to do that, and it was some of the most fun I've ever had in a driving game. It was just me, my buddy and the sheer exhilaration of driving really fast and messing around.

The Crew's story isn't exactly Pulitzer Prize winning material, but it's interesting enough. The voice acting is okay, and the story arcs are okay. They're not great, but they don't need to be. I don't know if anyone would want to buy The Crew for it's story and I can't think of a single RRPG (Racing RPG) that I have played that's had a strong story.

The gameplay is fantastic, and that's from a dirty plebeian who is playing by keyboard and mouse. I've wanted a good racing wheel for a while, but I never got around to buying one, and this game is the first one that's made me regret that decision. Using a wheel and pedals for this game would be the cherry on top of what is a really fun RRPG. Cars handle great, they sound great, the game looks great. It's just **fun** to drive, and do missions. It can feel a bit grindy at times if you are focusing on finishing all the skills and getting those perfect races. And thankfully, they knew that people would be restarting races over and over again, so they made it exceedingly easy to do so. A couple of button presses and you've restarted, there's no unnecessary time lost.

There's LOTS of stuff to do in the game too. Hidden stuff to find, easter eggs, and plenty of different missions types: Story Missions, Skills (which are like a set of challenges/mini races and reward you with car parts) and Faction Missions. Story Missions and Skills give you parts for your car and they've really focused on letting you have as much gameplay with as little micromanagement as possible. The only reason you have to stop playing and visit your home base is to assign your Perk points (which you get awarded with as you level up). Every time you get a new piece of gear you can apply it to your car right then and there. While that's not especially realistic, it definitely allows you have much more fun. The Crew is definitely more of a Arcade type racer than a simulation.

There's a wide variety of car parts to upgrade, and different cars to get. Each car can either be Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid or Circuit specced, and not all cars can be all things. Car A might only be able to be a Street and a Perf car while Car B could only be Dirt and Raid.

Be forewarned, though. The Crew has a heavy Pay To Win element in it in the form of Crew Credits (which it gives you 100,000 of to get you addicted) which is an alternative currency to the in game currency, and can be used in place of in game currency. For example, a car costing $100,000 would cost around 25,000 crew credits to purchase. It's the same for any initial kits you buy (Street, Perf, Dirt, Raid, Circuit, etc.) and any visual details for your car (colours, decals, hoods, roofs, side skirts, etc). So someone with a lot of money could just buy Crew Credits and then purchase the best Car for a particular type of race and destroy the competition. However, you can't buy parts from the shop (at least, as far as I have seen), they're only earned from doing Story Missions and Skill Missions. But Skill Missions happen in the open world, so depending on the type of Skill Mission you could just buy the best Car for each spec and it would be a LOT easier to get the best gear (Gold Level gear) simply because those cars you spent real money on are better. That all being said, the Pay To Win aspect of the game hasn't really bothered me so far, but I've been playing solo. I can imagine once you get into the competitive side of the game it could cause some problems.

I feel like I might be missing some things here, and this has been a bit rambling.

I'd love to hear from other people who have been playing the game.

**TL:DR;** The Crew is focused heavily on gameplay and that's where it absolutely *gleams*, it's really, really fun. The story is so-so, definitely not Pulitzer Prize winning material. It can feel a bit grindy if you're focused on squeezing every last drop of performance from your cars. There's a heavy Pay To Win element to the game - it's probably one of the most blatantly Pay To Win games I've played in recent memory.",The Crew - my impressions from the last few days of playing.
Games,"Obviously some games like an MMO arguably cannot be finished, but I'm interested in hearing from people what some of their favorite games are that they've just never gotten around to completing.

For me, it's Persona 4.  I'd heard great things, but new very little, and went in mostly blind to my first Shin Megami Tensei game.  I absolutely loved it from the very beginning, and played it for about 10 hours in 2 days.  I liked it so much in fact that I decided to step away from it for a while so that I wouldn't burn through it too quickly and be disappointed.  Now, about a year later, I've never gone back to it.  I know it's incredible, and I love the characters, but for whatever reason have yet to dive back in.

If anyone has any similar stories, I'd love to hear them.",What is your favorite game that you've never finished?
Games,"Once upon a time, I really enjoyed adventure games.  Everything from Myst to Gabriel Knight and The Longest Journey were some of my favorite games in my early PC gaming days.  The last adventure game I really enjoyed was Dreamfall.  I'm going to grab the new Kickstarted Longest Journey sequel soon and give it a shot, but the genre seems pretty barren now.

On the Steam Store, if you click on the 'Adventure' genre, you are presented with a list of games that are anything but.  The number 2 top seller right now is 'I am Bread' (which is a whole other level of shit progression in gaming I won't go into right now).  Red Faction and Far Cry 4 also top the list.  While I can see Far Cry 4 having some 'Adventure' aspects, what I can't see is how the current (as of this post) #23 top selling adventure game according to Steam: **NBA 2K15**.  What the actual everlasting fuck?

Games,"Now before you downvote please at least take the time to read what I have to say. This is coming someone who has played the originals at least 15 times.

To me ORAS doesn't feel like Hoenn. So much of it seems to be removed or changed to the point where it doesn't even feel like a remake to me. Even little stuff like no game corner, no safari zone, new animations on the cable car, not collecting soot really hurts the enjoyment of the game. I have done literally everything in the originals and the lack of little things like these makes the game not very fun. There are more issues I have with the game but another issue I have is how the revealed every mega beforehand. Megas have become one of the most important features in the game especially if you play competitively like me and learning that every mega was revealed before this game is incredibly disappointed. There was so much hype with X and Y and I would check here eery hour to see if a new pokemon or mega was found. With ORAS it seems like all of that was already done for us. My main issue though is with the post game. Now before you say I'm greedy and just mad about battle frontier hear me out. Looking at ORAS and Emerald, ORAS has less post game comparatively with the times. This is unacceptable especially after we've gotten games like HGSS. Emerald had 7 unique battle facilities, a trainer hill, cave openings in fallabor, an expanded safari zone, and more features. ORAS has none of those. All it has is a copy pasted battle maison from X and Y, a facility no one liked in the first place, and the Delta Episode. While the Delta Episode was nice it was something that could be completed in an hour unlike the battle frontier or other features which could take weeks. And before you say that this is a R/S remake also remember that this is the main hoenn remake and things like the battle frontier defined hoenn as a region. On top of that HGSS were basically crystal remakes with the features they had. The last post game thing that ORAS has is catching legendaries. Many people talk about that like it is a massive post game feature and how big it is that you can catch em all with just X and Y and ORAS but people always forget that this was possible with gen 3. With FRLG and RSE you were able to catch every pokemon including legendaries. ORAS simply has more because since the originals there have been 300+ more pokemon.

I'm not saying all of ORAS is terrible because I do love the new soundtrack and features such as soaring and dex nav but lack of this many features really turned me off the game. I was hoping this would be as great as HGSS but I was severely disappointed. Many of you will probably enjoy this game especially first timers to hoenn, but as someone who played this originals religiously I just don't find the games to be that great.

Games,"This could apply to anything at all in the wide world of video games you feel is either overdone or overlooked. From Youtubers and fan culture, to the competitive scene, to world settings, to their setting in time, to character tropes, to Ubisoft games all having towers to climb - anything at all. I know we all have a lot of things we wish could be lessened in favour of more innovation and creativity, what are they?

I was originally going to just ask what you were tired of, but I thought we could turn this into a more constructive and positive thread by talking about what we'd like to see more of as well. As much as we tire of things, it's just as important, if not more so, that we make it knows what we want to see more of and how it can be done well, as well as historical precedent. Please note, that I don't want anyone to assume that the things we are saying we're tired of shouldn't be done anymore, but maybe it would be good if they were lessened a bit to make room for other things that haven't had as much of the spotlight.

For me, I feel like I've had enough of fantasy games for a while. Not that they aren't still fun mechanically, or that they aren't doing things right and making some good design choices. I just feel like I've seen enough elves, swords and magic spells for the time being. In it's place I'd love to see more cyberpunk, or unique sci-fi. Cyberpunk, I think has been relatively rare, at least in the AAA scene and I really want to see some big developers run with it some more. I understand it's fairly niche (although not as niche as I think people assume) but I'm wishing here.

I'd also like to extend that to MMO's in general. The vast majority of MMO's seem to be fantasy based, and I think part of the reason (not the majority of course) that many flop is because they are so homogeneous. I'd personally like to see more present day MMOs and first person MMOs. If you're going to spend countless hours in a fictional world, I feel like first person should be a big consideration at least, since immersion would be a big plus in keeping people in your world. An FPS Cyberpunk MMO with a strong focus on world building and lore would be my ideal game, I guess.

Anyway, I've rambled on long enough. What themes, settings, and tropes in games do you think could use a break, and what do you think would be good to replace their ubiquity?","Video games have had many common themes, settings, and tropes over the years.

Games,"Any recent topics regarding the newest installment of the AC series have usually devolved into discussions regarding the poor optimization of the game and the plethora of bugs the game has been shipped with. For this post, I would like to move away from those discussions and rather discuss the pros and cons of the implemented mechanics. After all the negative criticism thrown at the game I think it would be healthy to point out the positive/negative changes to actual game mechanics.

Just in case anybody is interested - I played through the game on my PS4 and I have been having fairly consistent 30fps throughout my playthrough, with the occasional dips.

Pros:

1. I love the emphasis on stealth - the greatest bane of the series IMHO was that I never felt like an assassin but rather a glorified walking tank, that literally killed anything at a press of a button. This has thankfully changed due to several reasons:

a) The combat - suffice it to say it has been greatly improved. First of all, Counters are not insta-kills. You cannot spam kill an enemy anymore. Others in the group no longer wait for you to finish your counter to attack you. No regenerating health (I personally would however make it more challenging by not allowing the player to heal during combat). The camera no longer helps you - previously in the AC series the camera would adjust in such a way (at least most of the time) where the player had a general view of all his attackers. Now the player has to control the camera in order to get the best view. Initially I was severely annoyed by this change, as it was a big step away from the contemporary formula, however over time, I grew to really appreciate this. I find that I can manage to fight simultaneously 2-3 guys, however when I fought a larger pack of enemies I would find it difficult to keep everyone in my view and often I would get attacked by those ""outside"" my view. This actually forced me to choose my battles and has led me to not provoke the guards in certain situations.

b) You are incentivized to not go into combat - There is a fair number of side missions that grant a greater reward for not going into combat and actually staying incognito thought the whole mission. The rewards for going full incognito in most of the cases are substantially better than taking the purely aggressive route.

c) The implementation of the dedicated stealth - just the fact that I can sneak behind small objects and use them to my advantage adds a whole new level of enjoyment to the game.

d) Crowds have a purpose - In previous installations of AC, I found it a bit annoying to maintain my incognito status by jumping from one group of 3-4 people to another group of 3-4 people. In Unity it is in fact quite enjoyable to lose your pursuers in a large crowd of people and then to utilize that group of people to execute assassinations, after which you disappear in the crowd.

2.  These are the best side-missions in any game I have played. What really impressed me is that each side-mission felt like its own mini story. Each murder investigation is  unique and intriguing. The enigmas  requires the player to do investigative work and look through the codex for clues. Paris stories have their own mini campaigns for you to go through. This is the first time I've felt in an AC game where the incentive to play side-missions was not influenced by wanting to attain a certain object or getting 100%, but rather through a genuine interest by what the next side mission has to offer. Each mission adds enough variety to rid itself of the usual repetitiveness of side-activities (with the exception of the Enigmas, which got slightly stale towards the end).

3. Paris is absolutely beautiful - there is not much to say about the city which can't be seen in gameplay videos of AC: Unity. This is however the first time since AC:2 and AC:B that I just forgot about everything and decided to casually tour the city.

4.  Climbing buildings has been made more challenging - what I severely disliked in the more recent AC games was that there was no challenge to climbing buildings, press two buttons, hold forward and in 20 seconds you should be at the top. In AC: Unity many buildings have only few routes to the top or in some cases only one route. Even though it is not very challenging it does give a nice change of pace to the status quo of free-roaming.

5. Customization is finally here -  A multum of colors to customize the vast number of clothing available to the player finally gave me the ability to pimp out the main character. Add to that more weapons and guns than all the other AC games combined.



Cons: 

1. The free-roaming mechanic took one step forwards and sadly two steps back. Even though the free-roaming seems to be a bit more dynamic and a lot more flow to it (thanks to the descending and ascending options), there is still one thing, which infuriated me throughout my play through. To my knowledge it is not possible to leap from one side of a building to another building. Although this may seem like a minor issue, too often have I been in a situation, where I desired to leap across the street away from my building, whilst futilely spamming the jump button. If I wished to reach the building  on the other side of the street I must either descend all the way down to ground level or climb all the way up to roof level. EDIT 2: Apparently you CAN jump away from a building by holding RT + TRIGGER DOWN + TAPPING X (thanks to u/DrunkenNinja)

2. ""French"" men/women with British/American accents. This was a monumentally stupid decisions on Ubi's part and a near immersion killer for me. What is astounding is that they did it correctly with the AC:2 saga.

3. The friendly AI is fairly moronic.  There are too many examples to provide, which through the AI's stupidity I have indiscriminately died. My favorite part was in the mission to escape jail, were in a certain moment the AI was supposed to throw a smoke bomb at a large group of enemies, however for some reason the character froze with the bomb in his hand, unable to decide where to throw it, leading to the demise of both me and the AI.

4. Collectibles are still present - I always found it a cheap ploy to artificially inflate the number of content that's advertised in a game. Add to the fact that I have yet to find a person that enjoys collecting them. EDIT 3: Slight elaboration -  I'm not denouncing all collectibles but the way they were implemented. 1. There is an over-abundance of them. 2. There is no challenge in collecting them.

5. Now for the reason why I simultaneously hate this game - A.k.a. Uplay, and the need to be connected to the internet in certain instances. 

Want a special weapon? You'll have to use your Uplay Points . Want to open this blue chest? Download our ""free"" app which will pester you about upgrading to premium. Want to open this special gold chest? Ok. Connecting to the internet. Cannot connect to UBI server error 00000001FCKU, try again later. Rinse and repeat.

This is what especially saddens me about the series, is its gradual progress toward implementing  a F2P and triple A symbiosis. It started harmlessly enough in AC:BF with  booster packs, but now UBI is being more courageous with attempts to squeeze more out of the player. I'm afraid that it will become worse with each passing game.

TL:DR - Stealth has improved, thanks to an improved combat system and other factors. Customization is great. Paris looks great. The big crowds have an actual purpose. Side-missions are great. Please improve free-roaming and the AI. Get rid of collectibles and other useless fluff. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get rid of the cancer known as Uplay.

PS. I'm sorry I want be able to engage anyone soon after posting. I'll be back in about 7 hours. :)

Summary

&gt; Dutch indie developer Digital Dreams makes its console debut with Metrico, a unique infographic puzzle action game. Set in a world filled with infographics, Metrico challenges players through 6 worlds filled with bar charts, line diagrams and pie charts, each of which directly react to the player’s movements, actions and input. For example, one bar diagram might grow with each step a player takes to the left, while another might decline with every jump. Players must explore Metrico and carefully analyze every move to see how they affect the world and what will help them advance. This game mechanic, called “Input Morphing”, forces players to think about actions that they normally wouldn’t consider in a video game. Metrico is a combination of exploration, skill, experimentation, but above all: thinking outside of the box.

Games,"Certain puzzle-based games include puzzles of varying difficulty, where some puzzles are easy, some hard, some very hard, and then there are a few that are extremely hard. This is fine, but based on a recent experience in **The Talos Principle** I came over a puzzle that was extremely hard, and at the same time was related to the game's story. You wouldn't miss out the main element of the story, but you would miss exposure to elements that strongly fill out certain details of the story.

But in turn this had an even worse effect on me. For those who are not familiar with the game: it in addition to ""standard"" puzzles includes puzzles that are harder. If all of them are solved, they will provide certain information and content. This ""harder"" category ranges from extremely complicated to just straight forward harder system. It is the extremely complicated (i.e. which requires you to think that far out of the box that you need to use systems outside the game to solve it). Sure, I can after a certain time of failing look up a walkthrough, but that presents a big problem which I experience almost as game-breaking as a bug: how can I know which other of the game's puzzles are that extreme? How do I know that after failing to find an answer after 1 hour of thinking and searching, that the game is something that would require weeks of guessing and usage of outside systems to solve, or if it just requires another hour of careful in-game exploration?

In other words, it makes me sceptical to all the puzzles that I don't solve after a shorter period of time, as I don't know whether they at all are solvable. 

It would be okay, if the puzzle wasn't placed in the same category as the other 20 or so puzzles, if I somehow could tell that here I will need much more time. ",I would like to discuss the occassional over the top difficulty of puzzles in certain games (Talos Principle)

Summary

&gt;Thief: The Dark Project is a 1998 stealth video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. Set in a medieval steampunk metropolis called the City, the game follows Garrett, a master thief trained by a secret society. An expanded edition of the game, Thief Gold, was released in 1999.

Thief was the first PC stealth game to use light and sound as game mechanics. Its use of first-person perspective for non-confrontational gameplay challenged the first-person shooter market, which led the developers to call it a ""first-person sneaker"". The game combines complex artificial intelligence with simulation systems to allow for emergent gameplay. Thief '​s influence has been traced to later stealth titles such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Hitman.
Prompts:

* Why is Thief still so highly regarded today?

* Was the game ahead of its time? In what way?

* How was the story?

""Alas, the expansion suffers from the problems of its predecessors. The more self-consciously weird it gets, the easier it is to lose interest.  By this point the so-called ‘awesome button’ - that lets you perform running hurricanranas and dropkick yourself behind the wheels of vehicles -  is more of an ‘alright button’, the feeling of dissociation rising in direct relation to the ludicrous spectacle. While Gat out of Hell is easy to play, geared as it is towards brainless carnage, it’s also very hard to care about it. There’s a saying about Saints Row games - that it’s a stupid game made by clever people. That still rings true with Gat out of Hell, Volition using its funny bone like a blunt object.

Gat out of Hell is a great round off to the Saints Row adventure as it gets wackier and wackier, with it standing as a defiant parody of how the Saints ended up in this mess.""

As leery as I get of reboots, this is certainly one instance where I feel it makes a lot of sense. The series’ trademark silliness has reached such extremes that the reset button is a viable option now, a chance to bring things back down to earth – literally – and allow Volition to build itself back up to fever pitch. Regardless of where Saints Row‘s future lies, this expansion is pretty enjoyable, but not essential. It’s got some great new weapons and provides an easy excuse to dip back into a world of shameless comic violence – it’s also a fairly disposable adventure that doesn’t offer much in the way of essential material.

""Again, though, these gripes are things people have debated over for decades, and you ought to know by now if they’re a big problem for you or not. This review is thoroughly pointless from the standpoint of informing potential customers anything, but that’s okay. We got to rant about environmental design and zombies for a little while, and that has to be worth something. Minor annoyances aside with some of Resident Evil‘s more dated structural choices, it was a nostalgic blast to go through the ReREmake, to the point where I’m now merrily playing Resident Evil 2 on my PlayStation Vita because I’ve gotten back in the mood for Capcom’s spookily camp brand of schlock horror scares.""

Games,"This is something I've noticed with the majority of the AAA games when it comes to DLC multiplayer maps. You buy them for $8.00+ (seems way more expensive now), play them in their own individual playlist a few times and then it seems they go to waste more times than not. There are a few options available to solving this. Bungie had it best with Halo 3. You can buy the maps now, or wait until the next map pack arrives and you can get the last-gen for free. 

1. Do what Bungie did in Halo 3 and make them free after a period of time and then all the playlists have the free maps incorporated with original.

2. Make a separate playlist and segregate those who own the DLC and those who don't. (Not a good idea IMO)

3. Incorporate the paid maps into the lobbies. If everyone has a DLC map in the lobby, there is a chance it can come up... This isn't terrible but I feel the odds of everyone having the DLC + hitting a DLC map does not go well. (FYI: I've been playing Halo 3 lately and after probably 100+ games of social slayer, only twice have I gotten a DLC map)

4. Make them free at the get-go. - As gamers, we would obviously love that but more often than not it won't happen. 

5. Make them free.... with ads. - I know this is taboo with most games, adding advertisements within the game. I get it, I understand that's not popular but going the mobile-games system of generating revenue but not be a terrible idea. So here's how I can see it being a win-win. DLC gets released. You don't want to pay, so you choose to download them for free, but advertisements will show up in the lobby and loading screens. To get rid of the advertisements, you pay for the maps.

Games,"The general consensus is that Unity was shit. It simply wasn't a finished game. If they delayed it they would have had Unity and Victory come out in the same year.

I think that is why they didn't delay it. They don't think people would be willing to buy two full price Assassin's Creed games in a year.

I would. The time I most want to play an Assassin's Creed game is when I've just finished an Assassin's Creed game. If they can guarantee me a working game, I wan't to play it.

Would you buy 2 polished Assassin's Creed games in a year? I'm imagining Victory gets delayed to March and a new one comes out in November. For me a new game on PC costs ~35 euro so I suppose I'm in a different situation than console games who pay double that.

Games,"Long post regarding Assassin's Creed...if you're here to bash Ubisoft, this isn't the thread you're looking for

Ever since AC:2 debuted on the Xbox 360 5 years ago, I have been an unabashed fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise year in and year out. I've enjoyed almost every iteration of it (I have yet to play Rogue and Black Flag, the latter of which I'm moving to once I 100% Unity) to varying degrees and have gone through each of them to at least completion of the main story line. And because of all the time invested in this franchise over the years, I can confidently say that Assassin's Creed is on the decline.

It's easy to state why it's declining in terms of Publisher decisions(yearly releases to meet Ubisoft Quarterly Objectives, various satellite studios working on different AC games or even different parts of the same game, strict release dates and DLC/Add-on focus). In a perfect world, I would see Ubisoft take 2 years off releasing an AC game, get the studios working together, improve communication and focus Quality Control on one title to ensure polish. But there are too many behind-the-scene factors to guarantee that, so here's what I want to pitch instead: let's conceptualize a mega-game with all the best features of previous iterations and innovative new ones. Feedback welcome and encouraged.

Here's what I would like to see implemented from previous games into one superior experience:

**From AC2**
- Villa customization (like Monteriggioni) with upgradeable sections and defenses, maybe with a suicide Defend-your-HQ mission late in the game ala Mass Effect
- Return of using enemy weapons during combat (maybe by picking them up so the combat isn't rendered too easy). God that was sweet
- Return of Awesome variety of combat executions
- Tap into the same writing used for this game's characters. They were best of the franchise, easily
- Dungeon challenges. These were thoughtfully designed, rewarding, and the atmosphere was mysterious and ancient. Very cool

**From AC3**
- Return of chain-kill with Hidden Blade. Jumping from enemy to enemy striking them down was one of the best parts of this game
- Continuation of One button Climb/Descent control scheme (as AC:Unity has done. This is a much more fluid parkour system)

**From AC IV: Black Flag**
- Naval Exploration and missions (I must admit, I have yet to play this game, so I'm not the best resource on things to take from IV yet)

**From AC Unity**
- Complex, varied mission structure. This is one thing the game did great, IMO
- Continuation of Stealth Focus
- Expand on the Visual Engine
- Investigation Missions - keep these, they are refreshingly new (here's a shower thought of mine: make main story missions initially be an 'Investigation' where you must acquire clues about the target's appearance, wherabouts, patterns, etc. and have the main character deduce them in their Villa. You then have to go pick your target out of several different possible NPCs. Difficulty increasing with game completion)

**Additional Wishlist**
- Remove Smoke Bombs, or make them entirely defensive (i.e. enemies can still block in the smoke). Right now it's much too easy to just toss a smoke and mow everyone down
- Implement a rewarding and complex Assassin recuiting mini-game, where you can call on your 'team' in difficult spots
- Full drop-in, drop-out coop in the open-world. Not restricted to just Co-op missions
- Return of Competitive Multiplayer, with a Naval Combat mode (like you have to board your enemy ship and assassinate the captain).
- More emphasis on effects of AC Storyline on historical events. At the moment, AC stories are primarily Assassins vs. Templars with the occasional cameo from famous historical figures. Let's see more of what impact assassinating a historical figure has on the country and its future
- Fewer to no microtransationcs^hahaha yeah right
- Better polish and optimization

Games,"Hi, I posted this in the Nintendo forum and got some feedback from Nintendo people. Now I'd like to post this to the general gaming community here on reddit and check out the responses.

**TL;DR included at the end, but I'm looking for people to pick apart my whole argument. Please read the whole post if you're planning on coming at me with another standpoint.**

The PS4 is dominating right now because it has graphical power and doesn't focus on too much besides gaming.

The XB1 is falling behind because they were trying to get on Nintendo's game a bit and do a lot with Kinect to capture the casual crowd. It didn't work.

The Wii U is hopelessly behind because of terrible 3rd party support, admittedly shaky first party support and an innovation that wasn't as head-turning as the last one.


Look at the last gen. The Wii dominated because it took the old idea of motion controls, modernized it, and streamlined it to fit a great untapped market of casual gamers who didn't care about what's newest and shiniest and would rather throw down some Wii Bowling or Smash or Kart with their friends then get all hunkered down with Call of Duty or Batman. There is definitely still live multiplayer Call of Duty as a big market, but the Wii simply did multiplayer better.

As an added bonus, the overwhelming difference in graphics, the Wii being a non-HD unit with Gamecube graphics, didn't matter, as these controls allowed for so much more play that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

The Wii U tried to innovate again, bringing the idea of the 3DS to the living room. It wasn't revolutionary enough. It wasn't supported enough by the first party to encourage other developers to check it out and make cool games for it. Innovation was prized over power, and now we have a console with PS3 graphics (admittedly PLENTY for Mario games [look at SMG2 and other late gen titles as a last-gen evidence and SM3DW and others for current evidence]) that can't hang with any of the new ports, and while it could pick up a few late-gen titles from the PS3/360 era, it can't hang now.

So now, to let it flourish, do the same thing to the Wii U as they're doing to the 3DS (if you haven't heard about that, google or reddit ""New 3DS""). PS4 or beyond graphics to hang with current-gen ports. Capacitive multi-touch gamepad. Support for multiple gamepads. Pro controller bundled in to emphasize that it can ""hang"" with new ports, alongside a Wii Remote to emphasize it's still aimed partially at casual gamers. Same price as the competition, but with plenty of great first and third party titles on launch day to mix things up. 

**PREVIOUS SECTION EDIT:** Good feedback folks. Strike the pro controller from the bundle and focus on hardware, and I think it might work.

Also, those that mentioned Nintendo isn't trying to compete with the big shots, yeah, stick with the Wii U until Holiday 17 when they can shake things up and deliver a console that appeals to everyone. 

+ Current Nintendo gamers won't have much interest unless there is some STELLAR 1st *and* 3rd party support. It might even hit at the same price as whatever new ""slim"" iterations come along, giving new players that have been waiting (for a while now) on the new generation an angle to go for the new Nintendo offering.

+ Keep the Wii around with vWii. Let everyone play their old Wii, Gamecube, and then softmodded/VC N64/PS1 games and further down. Nintendo has always been the leader in backwards compatibility - here, they have a chance to go 2 full generations back AND MORE for a console at a great price point to those who want to keep on throwing down good ol' Wii Tennis with friends, but also would love to get nostalgic with some OoT or Star Fox 64.

This would be a potentially game-changing interjection. It would heat up Nintendo's third party game to the level that it can do anything the PS4 and XB1 can from here on out. Then when the PS5 hits, Nintendo has a year or three to make another decision about how to proceed.

Unfortunately, it would alienate anyone who needed a single console and decided the Wii U was the best investment (this is what I believe, but beside the point). Maybe the public doesn't understand that Nintendo does shorter home console lifespans than the competition, allowing them to interrupt the market at interesting times. The Wii U tried this by hitting early, but it was years too early and a dollar too short. So now let's try again, lining up beautifully with Nintendo's 5-6 year normal span, and hit 'em in the middle, right in the solar plexus.

 Release a Wii Next mid-gen, **edit:perhaps holiday 17** with all these improvements, and bring it back into the core gaming sphere. The gamepad is different and fun, but if they focus on simply improving everything to the point of 3rd party interest, Nintendo has a real chance.

**TL;DR:** I and others think Nintendo's next move should be to interject mid-current-gen with a Wii Next with PS4-or-beyond graphics and a better gamepad. Bundle it with a gamepad and a Wii remote/nunchuk (**edited out the pro controller bundle, that's too much**) to emphasize the balance-striking marketing to capture core gamers and casuals alike.

Games,"So a funny thing happened yesterday. 

A friend of mine asked why people were upset with Nintendo about their Youtube policy. I had no idea what they were talking about. I went to look it up and found out that there was a new content ~~extortion~~profit plan that I had no idea was announced. Why wasn't this on the sub?

I searched only to find out that one of us mods removed the original post citing Rule 11. Well, isn't that an interesting position to be in? Here's a moderator wondering why content wasn't on their sub only to find that another mod decided it wasn't suitable. 

Whoops.

------------------------------

A few things to clarify about the matter straight off before we go any further:

1) It was a mistake. A bad call. We all now understand and apologize for it.

2) Rule 11 was the wrong rule cited. The call was made more for Rule 3 than Rule 11. 

So, how does a mistake like this happen? Here's something many people don't realize about moderating r/Games: we don't agree on much. The few rules we do have are ones we all agree upon but there are plenty of cases where we will argue with each other about. A number of you have seen us reverse a decision in modmail. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2tbtsg/for_those_of_you_interested_in_stalker_from_the/) thread, for example, started a heated debate between myself and another mod over whether it should have stayed up or should have been a comment in the original thread. 

One example of content is matters like website news. Do we or do we not allow things like (hypothetical example) ""Twitch signs agreement with Ad Company #4""? Twitch is big among gamers but that news has nothing to do with games or affects games on Twitch at all-- the news is only about Twitch switching providers. We face questions like this everyday and sometimes the answers are easy, sometimes we argue about them for an hour or two until we decide.

In the case of this Nintendo business, one mod felt that it wasn't relevant to games and only covered Youtube and Let's Plays (which we don't allow) while another was ambivalent about it. So off it went, citing Rule 11. Both understood that it was a borderline removal at best. 

By the time the second thread on the matter was posted, only the third moderator was active. He wasn't around for decision on the first and thought the second was fine with no idea there was a first thread. But then the question was asked about the first. The mod answered as best he could but had no idea why the first was removed and only guessed at it. Mod #3 didn't reinstate the original thread because he did not want to step on anyone else's decisions. 

The rest of us, who all disagreed with that removal, only found out about the situation much later. I only found that second thread 22 hours after it was posted and that's because I went searching for that news on the sub. I found out about the removals through the comments section hours too late, not through modmail or through any of the other mods since I wasn't in contact for a day or so. 

This is the exact reason why we ask for modmails. It makes it much easier to fix mistakes when we actually know there are mistakes made. Not a single modmail was sent about that Nintendo thread but the issue was popular enough that there were many people wondering what happened.

So, a mod made a bad call. We all discussed the matter and realized that we, collectively, messed up. We do make mistakes from time to time. We are, after all, only human. If you ever feel something was removed in error, send us a modmail and we *will* get back to you. 

Since I found out, I've spoken to every other mod and made sure that we're all clear on the matter. I also found that the reason for removal was more akin to Rule 3's ""off-topic"" than it was Rule 11. This mixup was made due to a misunderstanding of what ""industry figures"" referred to and the mod's belief that this was more of a Youtube matter than a gaming matter. 

-------------

We had retooled our rules a few months ago to provide more consistency in our rulings. So far it's been a pretty big success but given that some inconsistencies do still happen, we've adjusted our wording a bit. For example, news Andrew Yoon's death is technically not allowed by Rule 11 but we did not originally come up with that rule to avoid major events like that. 

The original purpose of Rule 11 was to avoid articles discussing issues with the purpose of highlighting, praising, or attacking an individual or group despite a tenuous relation to actual games. It was, basically, our ""no social movements"" rule to avoid the rampant amount of negativity and constant fighting on the subreddit last year. Simple, factual information about major life events of gaming figures or groups was not meant to be covered by the rule but the language is vague enough to include that as well. 

To fix that, we've reworded Rule 11 to this: 

&amp;gt;**No content focusing on non-gaming related details of industry figures** - Content regarding individuals or groups is only allowed when it is directly related to a game or major life events (e.g. company move, death, acquirement, sponsorships, ""Gabe is the new CEO of Activision"" or ""Microsoft buys the Playstation brand for $10 and a pack of Oreos""). Posts that focus on non-gaming related details (e.g. ""CliffyB thinks Donnie Darko defines him as a person, insists that it's not a phase, mom"" or ""Does anyone else think that Valve should stop providing free junk food for their employees?"") are not allowed.

-----------------

Now, a matter for the community to decide: graphics cards.

There's some disagreement among us about whether news about graphics cards is appropriate for this subreddit. Some of us feel that they're components made purely for gaming, as much as consoles are, and so are definitely within the purview of this subreddit. Others feel that they're PC hardware and therefore more suited to technology and computer based subreddits than a gaming one.

But is it a good thing? Do you like playing a game in smaller chunks over time? Does it make it hard to keep up with the story?

I feel like there are some definite pros and cons to this structure.

Pros:
- Episodic games are, for some reason (probably following in telltale's steps) cheaper than full retail games, even if the amount of content is in many ways comparable.
- Allows the developer to work on the game without rushing and while gaining revenue, similar to the early access model.
- Is a naturally good fit for certain story lines.

Cons:
- Developers don't always stick to release calendar (I.e. Kentucky route zero's absolutely absurd release calendar).
- Developers that sell lots of 'season passes' up front may be less inclined to finish the game right (again, Kentucky Route Zero)
- Some games that would work better as a coherent whole are chopped into episodes to get them out the door faster (Life is Strange feels this way to me).
- Hurts immersion if episodes are too short (Walking dead season 2 wasn't quite as good as season 1 for me just because playing it in chunks left me to forget about the characters for long periods of time, whereas for season 1 I played all at once.)

In other words, he's not subtle about anything at all in this trailer.

Personally, the last Hitman movie, though a mediocre movie at best, was the best video game movie I've ever seen.  They changed up the clone subplot so that they could reuse some cheap stock footage at the beginning of the movie, but 47 still carried out a series of subtle assassinations, at leas until his hand was forced.  Timothy Olyphant's portrayal of 47 was also really good and pretty true to the character of the game.

But does any of this make for a good movie?  The Hitman games have never had much in the way of a story or characters, and they've mostly been a series of interconnected levels with challenges, as opposed to something like Uncharted or Mass Effect where story is as important as game design.

Games,"#[Call Of Duty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty)

##Description:
&gt;Call of Duty (commonly shortened to CoD) is a first-person video game franchise. The series began on the PC, and later expanded to consoles and handhelds. Several spin-off games have also been released. The earlier games in the series are set primarily in World War II, including Call of Duty, Call of Duty 2, and Call of Duty 3. Beginning with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which is set in modern times, the series has shifted focus away from World War II.

It’s early March  and Obsidian’s Pillars of Eternity launches in three weeks, yet no word has been mentioned by almost any of the mainstream video gaming sites. This title is a big deal, representing one of the primary catalysts behind the CRPG revival currently going on. After a near 15 year hiatus, the deep isometric role-playing games of the 90s and early 2000s have returned, proving that crowd-sourcing is an alternative funding method that permits the creation of niche products for niche audiences without requiring a large publisher’s capital. Thanks to the “vote-with-your-wallet” force behind Kickstarter, we’re seeing an influx of genre through games like Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera, in addition to 2014’s Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, and Shadowrun.

&amp;nbsp;

Pillars of Eternity is a throwback to classic games like Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2, Fallout 1 and 2, Planescape: Torment, games that represent a hallmark in western-style RPG and videogame narrative. They are the crème-de-la-crème of the decision-based nonlinear storytelling, and PoE is practically being designed by the same people who spearheaded Black Isle, the studio who had a hand in most of these games in one way or another. Hell, Obsidian is almost but Black Isle! (it was founded by the same studio head, and features some of the same talent.) PoE IS A SPIRTUAL SUCCESSOR TO BALDUR’S GATE 2. I’M SO EXCITED I’M BLOWING A GASKET (as you read).

&amp;nbsp;

For all it’s worth, here’s a rundown of everything you to know about the game:

&amp;nbsp;

**Crowdfunded**  
* Project Eternity raised 362% of its Kickstarter goal, earning a total of $3,989,929. This sets it apart as the second highest crowd funded game to date.  
* Originally called Project Eternity.  
* Completed its $1.1 million funding goal in 24 hours.  
* Features Tim Cain, Chris Avellone, and Josh Sawyer, some of the lead talent behind Planescape: Torment, Fallout 1 and 2, Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Wasteland 2, KoToR 2, Fallout: New Vegas, and Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer.  
   
&amp;nbsp;

**Scope**  
* Aesthetically influenced by the Infinity Engine games: Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale 1 and 2, and Planescape: Torment.  
* Features a combination of 3D character models and effects atop 2D pre-rendered backgrounds.  
* Inspired by Baldur Gate’s scope, Icewind Dale’s strategic combat, and Planescape: Torment’s mature writing.  
* The camera has a fixed position.  
* [Dialogue frames and menus](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/pe-ui-character-sheet.jpg) are also heavily influenced by Infinity Engine games.  
* Pillars of Eternity Character Sheet  
* Emphasizes embarking on adventures as well as exploring cities, dungeons, and wilderness.  
* Mechanics are not based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  
* Party-based exploration set in an original fantasy world.  
* The Party can be expanded to six members over the course of the game.  
* There are a total of eight original characters to recruit, in addition to unwritten but fully customizable characters.  
* Companion relationships influenced are by player-character background and the ongoing decisions.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Character creation**  
* Players select from five playable races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orlan, and Aumaua.  
* Human, Dwarf, and Elf are self-explanatory.  
* Orlan are halfling-sized humanoids with two-toned skin and large, fur-covered ears.  
* Aumaua are semi-aquatic humanoids with elongated heads, semi-webbed fingers/toes, pointy teeth, and varying skin patterns.  
* Godlike are a sub-race with five “ethnicities.” They are: Nature, Death, Avian, Moon, and Fire.  
* A Godlike can be created in any of the five races, but only Nature, Death, Moon, and Fire are accessible.  
* Players can choose from one of eleven character classes: Druid, Ranger, Monk, Cipher, Chanter, Barbarian, Priest, Rogue, Fighter, Wizard, Paladin.  
* Classes like the Barbarian, Rogue, fighter and Ranger are classic fantasy archetypes, whereas others, such the cipher, delve into the lore’s unique take on soul magic.  
* Primary attributes include: Might, dexterity, constitution, intellect, perception, and resolve.  
* Culture and background and are customizable, allowing the player to select from a scripted backstory whose influence tailors specific elements from the journey.  
* Background is dependent on cultural selection.  
* Both aspects are determined after player-character creation during a conversation with another character.
* You may opt to not reveal your background.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Lore — Setting**  
* The game is set in the world of [Eora](https://eternity.obsidian.net/img/media/artwork/pe-pillarsofeternitymap-1750x1426.jpg), which roughly approximates 16th century (1500 – 1600) level of technology and engineering; think Michelangelo, Tudor England, and the colonization of the ‘New World.’  
* Its central story takes place in a nation called Dyrwood, a heavily forested, coastal area representing colonial North America.  
* Dyrwood is settled by foreign powers from across the ocean.  
* Race relations appears to be a central theme, citing the tenuous relations between the colonizers and the native elf and orlan tribes.  
* Another major theme is the forbidden knowledge of ancient civilizations.  
* Colonial powers aggressively compete for artifacts of Dyrwood’s original inhabitants.  
* The player-character is a typical “chosen one” trope; a newcomer caught in bizarre and supernatural circumstances.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Lore — Magic**  
* Magic is created by accessing the power of a person’s soul, and its determined by the quality of their soul.  
* Sapient souls move through an endless cycle of waking life and purgatorial sleep, reincarnating multiple times across generations. The reincarnation process is not always perfect, sometimes resulting in “fractured souls.”  
* Soul characteristics are valued. These include “strong” souls, souls with a “pure” lineage, “traveled” souls that have drifted across various divine realms, “awakened” souls that recall their past lives, and souls that coexist in a single body.  
* Individuals can draw upon the soul to enact supernatural abilities like magic of super-strength. The body acts as a conduit and battery for the power.  
* Soul-based magic has little access to curative/healing magic.  
* Undeath makes sense for once — results when people tamper with soul in forbidden ways, often attempting achieve immortality by binding the soul to the body similar to a lich and its phylactery.  
* Body slowly decays over time unless the individual consumes the blood and flesh of the living.  
* Failure to do so causes the body to decompose all the way down to the bones and the mind to go mad.  
* Anyone attempting to disrupt the natural cycle of life, death, and reincarnation is considered necromancy.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Combat**  
* [Combat](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/combat.jpg) is a mix between real-time and tabletop, dice-roll based. Dice rolls occurring behind the scenes determine the outcome of everything, similar to Baldur’s Gate.  
* Pillars of Eternity adopts a “real-time with pause” combat system to assign actions to party members which can be paired with a slow combat toggle.  
* The game also supports an auto-pause feature with customizable guidelines for pausing.  
* Positioning and coordination are key to victory.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Customizable options — Combat**  
* Difficulty ranges include easy, normal, and hard. Difficulty affects monster variety and number, the loot pool, and limits amount of camping supplies that can carried as well as the amount of time spent resting. Here's a [screenshot](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/poepreview-image1.jpg) of a camp.  
* AI is unaffected by difficulty.  
* Perma Death option available, causing character who reach zero health to permanently die.  
* If permadeath is deactivated, characters dropping to zero health become maimed and are rendered incapacitated until the end of combat. Maimed characters can walk around and participate in combat, but suffer heavy health and attribute penalties until they’ve rested.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Customizable options — Difficulty**  
* Three optional challenge modes available for players seeking more difficulty.  
* Expert Mode: Enemies are more difficult and hints are disabled.  
* Trial of Iron: A single saved game is allotted for the entire campaign or until the player dies. Progress automatically saves and results in a deleted file if the party wipes, forcing the player to restart from the beginning.  
* Path of the Damned: Combat difficulty is maximized and enemy placement is no longer confined by difficulty.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Strongholds — Upgrades**  
* One of the kickstarter stretch goals added at the $3 million threshold.  
* [Upgradeable player-fortress](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/227f065d6dd6e926aeb583d1269f8dfb.jpg) with random events. Initially old and dilapidated, but upgrading unlocks new activities and events.  
* Upgrades adds to the stronghold’s prestige or security rating. Prestige increases the rate of “good” random events and income. Security increases the likelihood of succeeding at ""bad"" events such as raids.  
* Awards temporary attribute boosts via resting bonuses and permanent boosts through specialized buildings, e.g., building a library grants bonuses to your Lore skills.  
* Permits idle companions to be sent on their own adventures a la World of Warcraft’s garrison system.
* Source of crafting ingredients.  
* The stronghold’s estate includes surrounding lands, thereby imposing a tax on all of its inhabitants.  
* Tax amount increases with prestige, but may occasionally be lost to banditry.  
* Stronghold also includes a complex, multi-floor, underground dungeon.  
* Clearing the dungeon allows it to be converted into a prison, and gives players to option of taking named NPCs captive, rather than killing them after defeating them in combat.  
*These prisoners can be interacted and used as bargaining chips later in the game, but without a heightened security level, they may escape.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Strongholds — Random events**  
*Random events occur independently of the player’s presence. Some require immediate action, while others can resolved autonomously.  
*Visitors periodically arrive, creating an opportunity to increase prestige and security levels, or decrease them.   The player can deal with them accordingly, by prolonging their stay with funding or ushered to leave by escorting them to their next destination/paying them to leave.  
*These NPC periodically sell rare items and may even trade very rare items for captive prisoners.  
*Attacks are the most dangerous of the randomized events and are preceded by advanced warning.  
*The player can repel attacks directly or allow henchmen to resolve the conflict via simulated results.  
*Well-defended strongholds decreases the amount of damaged or destroyed upgrades, dead henchmen, and money lost.

Games,"It’s March 5th and Obsidian’s Pillars of Eternity launches in three weeks, yet no word has been mentioned by almost any of the mainstream video gaming sites. This title is a big deal, representing one of the primary catalysts behind the CRPG revival currently going on. After a near 15 year hiatus, the deep isometric role-playing games of the 90s and early 2000s have returned, proving that crowd-sourcing is an alternative funding method that permits the creation of niche products for niche audiences without requiring a large publisher’s capital. Thanks to the “vote-with-your-wallet” force behind Kickstarter, we’re seeing an influx of genre through games like Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera, in addition to 2014’s Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, and Shadowrun.

&amp;nbsp;

Pillars of Eternity is a throwback to classic games like Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2, Fallout 1 and 2, Planescape: Torment, games that represent a hallmark in western-style RPG and videogame narrative. They are the crème-de-la-crème of the decision-based nonlinear storytelling, and PoE is practically being designed by the same people who spearheaded Black Isle, the studio who had a hand in most of these games in one way or another. Hell, Obsidian is almost but Black Isle! (it was founded by the same studio head, and features some of the same talent.) PoE IS A SPIRTUAL SUCCESSOR TO BALDUR’S GATE 2. I’M SO EXCITED I’M BLOWING A GASKET (as you read).

&amp;nbsp;

{Gameplay Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2LrE3Ssnsg)

&amp;nbsp;

For all it’s worth, here’s a rundown of everything you to know about the game:

&amp;nbsp;

**Crowdfunded**
- Project Eternity raised 362% of its Kickstarter goal, earning a total of $3,989,929. This sets it apart as the second highest crowd funded game to date.
- Originally called Project Eternity.
- Completed its $1.1 million funding goal in 24 hours.
- Features Tim Cain, Chris Avellone, and Josh Sawyer, some of the lead talent behind Planescape: Torment, Fallout 1 and 2, Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Wasteland 2, KoToR 2, Fallout: New Vegas, and Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer.
   
&amp;nbsp;

**Scope**
- Aesthetically influenced by the Infinity Engine games: Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale 1 and 2, and Planescape: Torment.
- Features a combination of 3D character models and effects atop 2D pre-rendered backgrounds.
- Inspired by Baldur Gate’s scope, Icewind Dale’s strategic combat, and Planescape: Torment’s mature writing.
- The camera has a fixed position.
- [Dialogue frames and menus](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/pe-ui-character-sheet.jpg) are also heavily influenced by Infinity Engine games.
- Pillars of Eternity Character Sheet
- Emphasizes embarking on adventures as well as exploring cities, dungeons, and wilderness.
- Mechanics are not based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons
- Party-based exploration set in an original fantasy world.
- The Party can be expanded to six members over the course of the game
- There are a total of eight original characters to recruit, in addition to unwritten but fully customizable characters.
- Companion relationships influenced are by player-character background and the ongoing decisions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Character creation**
- Players select from five playable races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orlan, and Aumaua
- Human, Dwarf, and Elf are self-explanatory.
- Orlan are halfling-sized humanoids with two-toned skin and large, fur-covered ears.
- Aumaua are semi-aquatic humanoids with elongated heads, semi-webbed fingers/toes, pointy teeth, and varying skin patterns.
- Godlike are a sub-race with five “ethnicities.” They are: Nature, Death, Avian, Moon, and Fire.
- A Godlike can be created in any of the five races, but only Nature, Death, Moon, and Fire are accessible.
- Players can choose from one of eleven character classes: Druid, Ranger, Monk, Cipher, Chanter, Barbarian, Priest, Rogue, Fighter, Wizard, Paladin.
- Classes like the Barbarian, Rogue, fighter and Ranger are classic fantasy archetypes, whereas others, such the cipher, delve into the lore’s unique take on soul magic.
- Primary attributes include: Might, dexterity, constitution, intellect, perception, and resolve.
- Culture and background and are customizable, allowing the player to select from a scripted backstory whose influence tailors specific elements from the journey.
- Background is dependent on cultural selection.
- Both aspects are determined after player-character creation during a conversation with another character.
- You may opt to not reveal your background.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lore — Setting**
- The game is set in the world of [Eora](https://eternity.obsidian.net/img/media/artwork/pe-pillarsofeternitymap-1750x1426.jpg), which roughly approximates 16th century (1500 – 1600) level of technology and engineering; think Michelangelo, Tudor England, and the colonization of the ‘New World.’
- Its central story takes place in a nation called Dyrwood, a heavily forested, coastal area representing colonial North America.
- Dyrwood is settled by foreign powers from across the ocean.
- Race relations appears to be a central theme, citing the tenuous relations between the colonizers and the native elf and orlan tribes.
- Another major theme is the forbidden knowledge of ancient civilizations
- Colonial powers aggressively compete for artifacts of Dyrwood’s original inhabitants.
- The player-character is a typical “chosen one” trope; a newcomer caught in bizarre and supernatural circumstances.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lore — Magic**
- Magic is created by accessing the power of a person’s soul, and its determined by the quality of their soul.
- Sapient souls move through an endless cycle of waking life and purgatorial sleep, reincarnating multiple times across generations. The reincarnation process is not always perfect, sometimes resulting in “fractured souls.”
- Soul characteristics are valued. These include “strong” souls, souls with a “pure” lineage, “traveled” souls that have drifted across various divine realms, “awakened” souls that recall their past lives, and souls that coexist in a single body.
- Individuals can draw upon the soul to enact supernatural abilities like magic of super-strength. The body acts as a conduit and battery for the power.
- Soul-based magic has little access to curative/healing magic
- Undeath makes sense for once — results when people tamper with soul in forbidden ways, often attempting achieve immortality by binding the soul to the body similar to a lich and its phylactery.
- Body slowly decays over time unless the individual consumes the blood and flesh of the living.
- Failure to do so causes the body to decompose all the way down to the bones and the mind to go mad.
- Anyone attempting to disrupt the natural cycle of life, death, and reincarnation is considered necromancy.

&amp;nbsp;

**Combat**
- [Combat](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/combat.jpg) is a mix between real-time and tabletop, dice-roll based. Dice rolls occurring behind the scenes determine the outcome of everything, similar to Baldur’s Gate.
- Pillars of Eternity adopts a “real-time with pause” combat system to assign actions to party members which can be paired with a slow combat toggle.
- The game also supports an auto-pause feature with customizable guidelines for pausing.
- Positioning and coordination are key to victory*

&amp;nbsp;

**Customizable options — Combat**
- Difficulty ranges include easy, normal, and hard. Difficulty affects monster variety and number, the loot pool, and limits amount of camping supplies that can carried as well as the amount of time spent resting. Here's a [screenshot](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/poepreview-image1.jpg) of a camp.
- AI is unaffected by difficulty.
- Perma Death option available, causing character who reach zero health to permanently die.
- If permadeath is deactivated, characters dropping to zero health become maimed and are rendered incapacitated until the end of combat. Maimed characters can walk around and participate in combat, but suffer heavy health and attribute penalties until they’ve rested.

&amp;nbsp;

**Customizable options — Difficulty**
- Three optional challenge modes available for players seeking more difficulty
- Expert Mode: Enemies are more difficult and hints are disabled.
- Trial of Iron: A single saved game is allotted for the entire campaign or until the player dies. Progress automatically saves and results in a deleted file if the party wipes, forcing the player to restart from the beginning.
- Path of the Damned: Combat difficulty is maximized and enemy placement is no longer confined by difficulty.

&amp;nbsp;

**Strongholds — Upgrades**
- One of the kickstarter stretch goals added at the $3 million threshold.
- [Upgradeable player-fortress](https://gamezeit.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/227f065d6dd6e926aeb583d1269f8dfb.jpg) with random events. Initially old and dilapidated, but upgrading unlocks new activities and events.
- Upgrades adds to the stronghold’s prestige or security rating. Prestige increases the rate of “good” random events and income. Security
- Awards temporary attribute boosts via resting bonuses and permanent boosts through specialized buildings, e.g., building a library grants bonuses to your Lore skills.
- Permits idle companions to be sent on their own adventures a la World of Warcraft’s garrison system.
- Source of crafting ingredients.
- The stronghold’s estate includes surrounding lands, thereby imposing a tax on all of its inhabitants.
- Tax amount increases with prestige, but may occasionally be lost to banditry.
- Stronghold also includes a complex, multi-floor, underground dungeon.
- Clearing the dungeon allows it to be converted into a prison, and gives players to option of taking named NPCs captive, rather than killing them after defeating them in combat
- These prisoners can be interacted and used as bargaining chips later in the game, but without a heightened security level, they may escape.

Games,"A lot of people have been disappointed in what has been shown about the Steam Machines so far. I imagine it's because of different expectations - people wanted to see a something that competes with consoles while Valve just wants to take the PC/Steam experience to the living room. Personally I think both can be accomplished. I think there are 3 main reasons people aren't that invested in the machines at this moment.

///////////////// **CUSTOMER CHOICE** /////////////////

Valve keeps talking about how they want everything to be open and give people a lot of choice. This resulted in a lot of different Steam Machines from different companies. Unfortunately I think it scares off a lot of potential clients - people who these machines are aimed for. The enthusiasts are going to be building their own PCs anyway. The Steam Machines are supposed to target casual players / console owners who like the ease of choice. Valve could keep all the other Steam Machines (so people would really have choice), but also provide one of their own which they themselves can guarantee to be a great choice.

///////////////// **PRICE** /////////////////

The companies behind Steam Machines want to make money. They are using the same parts people can buy themselves, but also want to make a profit, this means the machines are going to be more expensive than you making one yourself at home. But to compete in the living room the machines need to be in the similar price range of the consoles. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo don't have to make a profit on their consoles, because they will also make money on games (and selling online access). That's why some console makers have even sold their console at a loss. For this reason the Steam Machines simply cannot compete. But Valve could change that with their own machine. Now I'm not saying they should sell them at a loss, but they could sell the machines with no or very little profit. They are most likely going to make the money back on Steam users anyway.



/////////////////
**HARDWARE**
/////////////////

I think it's a sad truth that PC hardware does age faster than console hardware. A PC bought in 2006 for the same price as a 360 or even higher simply won't run games released today (even if you play them at the lowest settings in 720p). A Steam Machine bought today for $500 will most likely play games worse than consoles in a few years (even if it is more powerful). I'm not a game developer, but I see 2 simple reasons behind this. The first reason is that on console developers get better access to hardware. Now this might be something that change on PC with Vulkan (or Mantel, or DX12 or whatever). However, the second reason is that developers on the PC simply have to make their game work with almost limitless amount of hardware configurations. For a console they only have one type of hardware and they can make the best of that. With multiple Steam Machines this problem isn't solved either. But with one special Steam Machine every PC game developer could make sure that their game works really well with that type of PC.

/////////////////

What do you guys think?",Should Valve make their own Steam Machine?
Games,"Jeff Minter has just [revealed on his forum](http://yakyak.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=85897#) that Atari have threatened him with a series of legal accusations which essentially tell him that he stole ideas from Atari in order to make TxK in an act of blatant plagiarism. 

Jeff Minter is a veteran game developer who today lives with a herd of amazingly pretty sheep. He is the original author of a game called Tempest 2000 and quite recently made TxK as a spiritual successor. Atari have claimed that *they* owned all the IP relating to Tempest and have told Jeff that TxK is a blatant rip off of ""their"" idea.

Jeff points out that Atari themselves made a blatant rip off of Tempest 2000 and made enough changes to ""avoid royalties"".

Games,"Hi,
 
as it gains acceptance, I'm really interested about the potential for speech recognition to improve UIs in gaming over the next few years, and particularly to get rid of giant, immersion breaking, scrolling lists of things that you have to select from, and to not only replace giant lists of keys, but increase the number of potential ""virtual key bindings"" on a game way past the number of keys on a keyboard. I know it's been knocking about for years but it seems to have improved a lot recently and I only became aware of how much a few weeks ago. I made up a video on youtube where I give a demo of it in action (using elite dangerous and the Astra add-on, but it could be used for most games - and I talk a bit about the kinds it can work for and the kinds it can't). 

Here's the link.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRVCkUN_Mq8

It's a bit long at about 26 minutes but you can skip to the bit you are interested in with some annotations at the start.

I start off with a quick background about speech recognition and elite, then a demo of it in action (at 6:30), and finally some tips on how to set it up yourself (at 18:30) so that you can avoid the current problems with the speech recognition engines almost entirely.

Are many of you using speech recognition? What problems or benefits do you see with it in the future? I used the voice attack software, but presumably there are decent alternatives out there too. What other ones would you recommend?

It reminded me of how much I used to love wrestling games on the N64 and PS/early PS2. I've played a few since then, but most seemed to not live up to past games. Create-A-Player is usually second-to-none, often with great details and customization abilities. However, the ""story mode"" seems to have fallen off drastically, going for more linear play than letting you go your own path. But maybe that's just viewing the past through rose tinted glasses?

Games,"It seems like in every single online video game there is a meta. Once it has been established, everyone follows it in order to ensure maximum efficiency. If you try going against the meta, expect to experience plenty of unpleasantness. It seems to suck all of the fun out of the game.

For example in Hearthstone if you try to play a deck of your own design with fun ideas, prepare to get squashed even at the lowest of ranks, by everyone running proven efficient meta decks. You can be of great skill and still won't make it very far unless following the meta. 

League of Legends has a meta that is like a gigantic bible of unspoken hidden rules. Pick the wrong champion, go down the wrong lane, buy the wrong item, and hell awaits you. You have to do everything by the meta, even in unranked normal matches.

I suppose it is inevitable. Once people figure out the most optimal way of doing things, from then on people will do nothing but that. It just seems to squash creativity. Why risk potentially losing by trying new things, when there is a proven method that everyone else is doing. 

Sorry if this is a bit of a rant. I've been playing a lot of competitive games in which the meta is a very influencing factor. It seems like a lot of people are only interested in winning even if it means being following the herd, rather than trying to have fun and doing their own thing.",I hate the meta.

Games,"Really great video to supplement my point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc

I want to express this view. And it's about something that **creators and audiences can change :)** [edit] I hope this doesn't create anger, but discussion, I want us to all be kind to one another. Here goes:

I've noticed a lot recently people from all political persuasions getting ""outraged"" in both tone and dialogue on a variety of topics that come up in this space.  

It seems like if someone has an opinion, there has to be a long, drawn out, angry rebuttal, or a tweet containing at least one word in all caps.

Then I look at a lot of popular video content, which is often angry rants depicted in a tone of ""I am right, here's why"" - then there are the comments...

I really genuinely love (and subscribe to/read!) these guys who sometimes succumb to this schtick (hindsight has prompted me to remove names) and they do have an infectious enthusiasm - but I tend to feel tired if I watch any videos (or read tweets) where they are clearly annoyed or overly negative about any particular topic, game or issue. Conversely, when I watch a video about something they love or like, I tend to be quite uplifted and really enjoy those vibes, it feels different and the true passion for the art comes through.

I'm finding the only show I really watch religiously is ABCTV's Good Game, because any negative criticism is just there as a matter of course, rather than pushed as part of the entertainment.

Youtubers and writers do also do this too, in fact, I've really enjoyed it when critiques of games have mentioned how the game could be improved, without the underlying ""I feel annoyed and jipped because this part sucks"" element to the criticism.

To me, the reactionary element to games discussion, the negative emotional expositions are more troublesome for everyone than the much derided ""youtube bait"" scare videos people here are seen complaining about.

At least in those videos, which I actually don't have a problem with, the audience is deriving entertainment from the youtuber being scared and being the butt of the joke. You are laughing at them being spooked.

With criticism, I find sometimes the critic is getting views and traction from their overly negative tone in response to a game, the game being the ""butt of the joke"", which is worse than the scare video example above.

*e.g. 'Look at this! Look how unbelievably bad this is! I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY ARE CHARGING MONEY FOR THIS!' 'Fix your god damn game!' 'X game is really unbelievably sexist!' 'Y game is NOT racist, if you think that you are a fool!' 'I'm sorry, but...!'* - I get quite exhausted by it.

Instead (respectively): *'The controls aren't as responsive to my liking, definitely a few bugs that could use ironing out' 'The AI pathing causes problems when executing a manuever, so I hope that can be fixed' 'I thought the female characters didn't have enough depth, you could improve them with XYZ' 'I didn't think it was a racist game' 'I feel differently about the situation'*

**TL;DR**: (In my personal opinion) Games critique is good when it stays constructive or positive and doesn't contain outrage or anger. When it does contain an angry, outraged or loud tone: it immediately shifts the tone of the discussion overall to the detriment of this community - reviewers who do this aren't bad people, they all have an intoxicating enthusiasm which is great when it's positive and there is no doubt they are clearly passionate about this medium. I just feel that coverage that has suggestion based criticism, non-emotional criticism of negative issues and an emphasis on what games do get right, we may cultivate a better atmosphere online. 

Can we, everyone, change this :) ?

&amp;lt;3

NOTE: I realize this argument is partly a tone police one (is that what it's called?), but I feel tone is important to shaping a good community. I am exhausted by the simmering negativity in this space.

NOTE2: Please don't condemn anyone who you feel contributes to this negative tone, as that is basically being negative in of itself, I'm trying to highlight something we can all contribute to fixing here. 

NOTE 3: Of course, audience, writer, pundit, reader, poster etc. everyone involved in this chain cultivates the tonal preference to negativity, positivity brings so much joy, though, it would be amazing to see this shift :)

Games,"Have you ever felt like you wanted to be a half-demon, half whole grain hybrid? In Bossa Studios new game, I am Bread, that's exactly what you can be. Reminiscent of a dream I had last thursday, I am Bread offers a surprisingly fun mix of humour, wall climbing, and awesome parkour tricks. 

**Gameplay**

True to its name, you play as a slice of bread. No, seriously. Your entire mission as you traverse through I am Bread's eight different story missions is to find a way to toast yourself. Using the 1-4 keys on your keyboard, or the four triggers on the controller, you grip onto surfaces or objects. I recommend playing on controller; I tried both and controller was much easier.  You can climb walls and objects, but you are limited to how long you can hold onto surfaces by the grip-meter that gets smaller the longer you hold on. You lose by becoming inedible. The floor, as well as different types of objects (candy, fish bones, etc) will you make you less edible for the longer you touch them. The first level is fairly simple, since you just have to make your way into the toaster. As you get to the higher levels though , the difficulty becomes immense; you have to turn on different switches, and get to harder-to-reach areas to become toast.
When you first start I am Bread, the game is seriously impossible. The physics of the game seem strange, and it's hard to tell which trigger needs to be pressed as you're spinning through the air after a jump. After playing for a while though, you start to pick up the nuances of the game. Wall climbing becomes easy, and you get a general idea of which direction you are going to go when you move the analogue stick. Trying to find out how you're going to get toasted is quite challenging as well. I found it much easier to find out where I was supposed to go the higher up I was, since I could get a bread's-eye view (get it)  of the map.

Admittedly, I struggled to get through this game. Luckily, the developers have added a cheat mode if you die enough times. After your third death on the same level, a glowing can of marmalade appears. It makes you invulnerable to everything, as well as makes your grip meter infinite. For the people that like to play through these quirky games slowly, like me, this is much appreciated. I could take my time to check out all the different ways to get toasted in each level, and could plan out my route of attack easily.

Different game modes are unlocked as you play; Rampage Mode, Free Roam, Cheese Hunt, Bagel Race, and Zero G. Each mode offers a different take on the levels that you have already played.

**Story**

The story to I am Bread is surprisingly sinister. You drive a man insane as you break through his house trying to get toasted. In between each level, a psychology report is written by the man's therapist, detailing his descent into madness. He raves about everything being ""the bread's fault"", when that's clearly impossible, right?

**User Interface
**
I am Bread's interface is minimalistic, and pleasing to the eye. There are only five different icons on your screen: The edibility meter, the grip meter, the clock, the back/screenshot button, and the trigger icons. None of the icons are too big, and leave enough room on the screen for you to focus on the gameplay. The menus are all very straightforward, with no clutter to distract you from anything, and easily navigated. I did experience a bug where the start menu wouldn't dissapear after a level, but it was an easy fix just to restart the game.

**Faults**

For what it is, there aren't many faults to I am Bread. It delivers exactly what it set out to be. That being said, it isn't much. It's about two hours worth of a funny shtick. Sure, you're bread, but that's about it. If you're into speed runs and challenging physics games, I could see I am Bread being very entertaining, but it's incredibly short, with gameplay that gets tiresome quickly. I didn't feel invigorated after I beat each level, I felt empty relief that I didn't have to do that level again. I am Bread feels too frustrating to play, since it's purposefully hard.

**Conclusion**

It's quirky, but that's about it. It doesn't have any major bugs, and at its sale price of $10 CAD, I think you're paying for what you get. You can spend some time and just mess around with I am Bread, but not much else. The game is too short, and too much of a gimmick for me to say that it's a must have in your steam library. It offers a certain charm, but that's not enough for me to keep playing it.

Games,"Square Enix is there **only** developer that I am aware of that regionally restricts most of their games that are bought directly from Steam from South East Asia. 

Activision, Ubisoft, Bethesda, 2K Games, Bohemia Interactive, Warner Bros etc...**none** of them restrict their games that are purchased from South East Asia to be played anywhere else in the world. 

The following are examples of games/packages that are play locked:

- FFXII / FFXII-2

- Deus Ex HR Directors Cut

- Murdered Soul Suspect

- Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition

- Tomb Raider GOTY 

- Hitman Absolution

- Temple of Osiris

Examples of games that are not play locked:

- Thief (2014)

- Life is Strange'

- FF VII

- Tomb Raider (non-GOTY)

I cannot think of any reason why they would do this, and neither is there a pattern to it...just seems random. Now, imagine someone from South East Asia who has a number of these Square Enix games...when he or she moves to the US for example to further their studies or to move there permanently, these games will simply not work for they are limited to be played within the region they are bought in. 

Considering Steam has anyway disabled cross-region trading, I simply cannot see any justification for this. Also, it's not like these versions of the games have edited content (such as censored/removed content due to local laws). They are pretty much 100% the same as the same versions of the games obtained from the US or Europe. 

Additionally, while some of these games do have a prominent warning displayed on the store page, not all of them do - FFXII/-2, Murdered Soul Suspect and Temple of Osiris for example do not have any warning. 

I have tried to reach out to Square Enix, cause it is possible they are not aware that Steam has disabled cross regional trading and that this policy of theirs is at the end of the day is just a huge inconvenience for their legitimate paying customer base. However, I wasn't able to find any contact info, and a post of mine on their forums has gone unnoticed for a couple of months. So, if anyone has any idea how I could reach out to either them or Steam to correct what in my opinion is an injustice, I would greatly appreciate it! 

Thanks! ","Why does Square Enix ""play lock"" or implement ""regional restrictions"" for most of their games on Steam when bought from South East Asia (or Asia in general)?"

Our small studio has just [launched its first Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/292879712/ultimate-chicken-horse). The game is called Ultimate Chicken Horse, and we'd be grateful if you could take a look.

It's a party platformer game where everybody gets to **build the level**, and try to run through to reach the flag. You only get points when you get to the flag, but your friends can't.  If **everybody wins or dies**, then nobody gets any points. You can either play the default competitive mode where players take turns strategically placing any piece they want and then running the levels, or hit the **Party Button** to turn on Party Mode, where everyone places and runs all at once. If you're playing with more than two people, Party Mode is definitely the way to go.

Here is an example of a level in the game when it starts: [it's pretty barren](http://gfycat.com/MaleMammothHyena) 

Compare that to what it can look like when it's finished: [a complete deathtrap!](https://gfycat.com/AlarmedImprobableAmmonite).

[**Here is a trailer for it**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC5nB01aBsk) It's mostly just the first half of the Kickstarter video, but it gives you a decent idea what the game looks like in motion.

If you do like the look of it but want to give it a go before making a decision, [the kickstarter page has a **downloadable demo**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/292879712/ultimate-chicken-horse) for Windows, Mac and Linux. If you're worried that you don't have enough controllers for a multiplayer game or if you want to use your keyboard, the game has a Hotseat mode (it's actually a couch) so players can share controllers.

If you want to see some in-depth development info about the game, our artist, Kyler, has made two posts on /r/GameDev about it in the last few weeks.

1. The first explains an animation technique called ""smears"" that he uses which dramatically improves the fluidity of the characters' apparent motions: [Why really weird looking drawings make the animation of our game look and feel way better.](http://np.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/334d02/why_really_weird_looking_drawings_make_the/)

Games,"I just watched the trailer for Jurassic World, the movie coming out this June that in my opinion looks like it is going to be good. I trust this assessment based soley on the teaser and regular trailer which combined are about 3 minutes of unique video. If I can I will probably see this movie with my friends in the first few days it is in theaters and probably check zero reviews. Why is it that I can do that and still expect to see a good movie a reasonably high percentage of the time? I think it is because the advertisement matches the media of the final product and the length is proportionally sound.       
         
Trailers for movies are the exact same media as the movie itself, a noninteractive series of images telling a story. A video game trailer however lacks interactivity which is a key component of any video game regardless of genre. The skills and technology needed to make a good video game trailer are not related to the skills needed to make a good video game. It'd be like calling Tolkien a good dungeon master because he can tell a great story in a fantasy setting.        
         
I think if people are going to trust video game advertising then we need to go back to the world of demos that was my way of life when I had a PS3, it seemed every title from Ratchet and Clank to Killzone to Red Faction: Guerrilla had a demo available for download for free. I think we all need to start asking for Demos again because Demos are the exact same form of media and also generally last for about 1% of play time give or take a percent. That is what I think is the most important part, in order to complete or feel done with a good game we want to have 10, 20, 40 sometimes 100 hours or more spent on a game where the longest movie I have ever watched was Godfather which lasted 3 hours and some change, so for a movie 3 minutes of trailer is enough but for a game we should expect at least a 10-15 minute demo in order to try it out.       
        
Am I wrong, are we to solely trust reviewers and trailers because as of right now I do not want to purchase any of the big titles. The Star Wars Battlefront Trailer (which is what prompted this post) looks  stellar to me, however I will not be pre-ordering it or even considering buying it in the first month. I need to wait for level headed reviewers to play the game and for fanboys to quiet down so I can get a rational consensus on whether the game is good. Isn't that kind of absurd, Why not release a demo where I can play the game a couple times and try it out before launch then I would feel comfortable buying a $60+ game on launch week or maybe even pre-order again. Which after Watch Dogs is not going to be happening again for a while.       
       
TL;DR Demos are the most appropriate form of video game advertising yet they are no longer a thing in a real sense. We should ask for these to become common again so we can test out a game before we purchase it. ",A thought about the nature of gaming ads and demos
Games,"This is a conversation between mostly PC based friends who are getting continually upset about the lack of features in Battlefront.

But this is making them question why split screen is being ""pulled out of off"" the console versions of the game, and leaving the PC games to be only for the one player.

In my opinion, and I don't know how to structure it well, but that's just how PC gaming works...? I don't know. What does everyone here think?",In regards to Battlefront being split screen on consoles... Why should consoles have such a major feature but PCs don't?
Games,"I had literally *never* heard of split screen PC gaming before this week.  As far as I know, I don't own a game that even has it as an option.  Yet somehow the entire Internet is losing its mind because Battlefront only has split screen on consoles.  There's got to be something I'm missing here.

So, /r/games, what's the big deal here?  What other games have split screen?  Why aren't we upset at the umpteen other games that never had it?",Split Screen PC Games--or--Why is Everyone so Upset?
Games,"Growing up, I was always a big fan of flash mini-games that were sort of the 'easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master'. Most are basic sort of tests of things like reaction speed, timing, etc. I am working on an RPG as a side project and I want to incorporate these sort of mechanics into all aspects of the game. 

In most MMOs, you simply need materials and a crafting bench to make an item. You hit the shiny button, wait a few seconds, and you have a new item. This could easily have some sort of mini-game involved in the process. Say you were crafting a sword, you would heat the metal up and have to time some sort of button clicks to 'forge' the sword, and depending on timing and placement the stats may be a little higher or lower depending on how well you did in said mini-game.  This would also give people an incentive to spend time doing things like crafting and have their skill contribute more to rewarding the time they spend doing it.  it feels less mindless, and other players will pay more money for well-crafted items!

So that brings me to my actual question, /r/Games[1] - what are some of the more compelling mini-games or tests of skill you've seen utilized in games? Is anyone familiar with any sort of collection of resources online for this type of thing?",Making Crafting Skill-Based in RPGs and MMOs
Games,"Hi, I'm the programmer on the 3 person team making **Ultimate Chicken Horse**. The game is in its [last 48 hours on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/292879712/ultimate-chicken-horse/). Reddit gave us a huge boost at the start which we are completely grateful for and now we need Reddit's help to reach our last stretch goals. 

For the uninitiated, [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFdjL4elfPU) explains the game better than I do, but I'll try anyway. The game is a competitive platformer where each player takes turn placing a piece into the level, then each player tries to reach the end. The pieces vary from simple blocks and platformers, to wacky and dangerous ones like fire hydrants and spinning saws of death! The object is to make the level hard enough that your opponents can't make it to the end, but not so hard that you can't make it yourself. If that sounds slow, there's also a party mode that ups the chaos where everyone places pieces and runs the level at once. If you're alone or just want to practice your platforming skills, there's also going to be a single-player Puzzle Mode where you have to place your pieces wisely to reach the end of each level.

I know that Kickstarter reminders sometimes rub /r/Games readers the wrong way, so I'd like to take this opportunity to turn this thread into a real discussion about what it takes to get a small indie game to this point and take any questions you guys have about how we did it. 

In short, the game started at a game jam and was a lot more rudimentary than what we have now. Because of the positive feedback we got, we decided to buckle down and grow it into a full game. We went up on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=378450001), went to events, moved into a shared workspace so we could actually work closely together, started our [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/292879712/ultimate-chicken-horse), got greenlit on Steam (probably because of Reddit), reached 100% on Kickstarter and now here we are. All the while the game itself has grown past what we imagined when we started and we have so much we still want to do. If there's any part of that you want to know more about, I would be more than glad to answer your questions and I know the other two members of the team will be lurking here too all day.

Games,"Blizzard got a lot of shit for their take on Diablo 3 during the first two years of it's existence, and rightly so. That version of Diablo 3 was a mess, and wasn't really fun to play. Of course, there was that tight combat Diablo 3 has become know for, that's always been there, but with nothing else to back it up, it became a hollow game ran by it's auction house. So what is the big difference between Diablo 3 may 15 2012 and Diablo 3 may 15 2015? Well I'll introduce you to some of the differences.

* Auction house is gone. Yes, it was removed right before the last expansion. Blizzard had a system where useful loot was in very limited supply, so the auction house wouldn't be flooded (remember, there was a credit card auction house as well) with good stuff. For the average player, full legendary outfit would not have been reasonable without opening your checkbook. Today loot is ""smart"", less stats on items, and has an 80% chace to drop your mainstat. Today most players have full legendary outfit by day 2 at level 70.

* Difficulties has gotten an overhaul. No more normal, nightmare, hell and inferno. No more playing the campaign three times before getting to endgame content. Today's difficulty settings include Normal, Hard, Expert, Master and Torment 1-6, and you can choose from these at will upon creation of a new character. This in combination with items and newly introduced gems has allowed for quick leveling of new characters, both through standard play and so called powerleveling. Powerleveling is a very quick method of leveling characters, in some cases not a longer process than about a minute, [as displayed here by DatModz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iT6407sl-0), one of D3's most known streamers.

* Adventure mode. Adventure mode is a new game mode parallell with the Story mode. You either play one or the other at any one time. If you ever played Diablo 3 before Reaper of Souls you know pretty well how exciting Story mode is, eh? Yeah, not very. Adventure mode opens up all acts at the same time, and let's you complete 5 bounties in each act per game, for rewards as the occasional [Ring of Royal Grandeur](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ring-of-royal-grandeur-3qRFop), among other legendary loot. Here you also find Rift keys, which you use to open...

* Rifts. Reaper of souls introduced Rifts, and in a later patch Greater Rifts. Rifts are random dungeons in which most of Diablo's action happens today. A rift is packed with mobs and elites and serves the grounds for finding gear and crafting materials. The layout is completely randomized as well as having a much darker tint than the rest of the game. At the end of the rift a Guardian spawns. The guardian is usually a bigger version of standard mobs, but hit's harder and has some special abilities. Later patches have introduced new rift guardians with more exciting gameplay mechanics. 

* Greater Rifts. The competitive side of Diablo 3. It's here where players like Quin69, Alkaizer, DatModz and more battle out for top rankings on leaderboards. In the previously mentioned rifts, you can find special rift keys, Keystone of Trials, which you use to open a trial for Greater rifts. Based on your skill and the character power you get a Greater Rift key with a number after the trial, which indicates what level Greater rift you are ready for. After finishing the Greater Rift you can choose to level up your Greater rift key, or level up any of the new Legendary Gems introduced with Greater Rifts. Greater Rifts is supposed to be this endless mode with increasing difficulty each level. As of today solo players are closing in on Greater Rift level 60 (of 100 available levels), while four man groups are nearing Greater Rift level 70.

* Seasons. Remember Ladders from Diablo 2? This is the same idea. Seasons reset your account, or at least the seasonal part of it, and let you begin at 0 again. Might not sound that attractive, but all your progression in the previous season is saved, but transferred to ""non-season"" which means that character can no longer compete in seasonal leaderboards in Greater Rifts. The seasonal reset also provides a new starting ground for all players. Had some bad luck when starting the season last time? Here's another shot at getting decked out in OP gear as fast as possible. After a certain point in Diablo, upgrades become few and far between, and in 0.001% upgrade increments. At the beginning of a season it's not hard to find 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% damage increase items which to me personally is a lot more fun than 0.001%. In short seasons provide a clean slate where everyone starts over and can compete on the same terms (for a while at least).

* Jay Wilson was fired. Yes, [he was fired](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/7592242994) two years ago (right around when D3 started becoming a better game, actually). It's debated wheter Jay was fired or not. But seeing as D3 completely tanked and made the most hyped game of the 2010's yet, into the biggest disappointment of the 2000's so far under his command, while at the same time calling one of Diablo 2's creative minds (David Brevik) a [fucking loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgQJGruEsno), it's not that much of a far-fetched conclusion to draw when he leaves Diablo 3 development four month's later.

* The new development team. Josh Mosquiera was brought in as the new game director, and since then the development team actually listens to constructive feedback, the most exciting part with the new team. Since Josh' arrival in 2013, content patches have arrived steadily, improving the game at a steady pace. 

Under the new leadership this game has grown from a disappointment into a game I've invested almost 900 hours the last 12 months. I firmly believe that as of today, Diablo 3 is a game that will live on for years and years, as long as the team keep doing the awesome work that is being made. Sure, there are still problems, power creep is a big one, and there's still no word on PvP (originally announced for release, then delayed until the first content update after release, and the dropped down into development hell), but the game that is here now rewards you for putting the hours required in, and that is what Diablo has always been about. Time in, loot out.

Games,"Starcraft 2 still has a very strong competitive scene, but it seems like the game has struggled to keep up with other competitive games like MOBAs and CS:GO, particularly in terms of mainstream popularity.

SC2 is much different from other competitive games, so there are many reasons why a lot of casual SC2 players may have lost interest in the game. But personally, as a big SC2 fan, I've been very disappointed with Blizzard's approach to growing and maintaining the game. Specifically, I'm disappointed with how long Blizzard has been taking to create expansions. In my opinion, there would be two good ways to do SC2 expansions:

1. Frequently add noteworthy features to the game to keep players coming back.

2. Make major changes or additions to the game in order to keep the game moving forward and gain new fans.

Blizzard isn't trying to do either of these things. They're taking three years to make each expansion, but the changes in each expansion are relatively small and aren't very meaningful in terms of moving the game forward. (A meaningful change, in my opinion, would be something like adding more emphasis on 4v4 matches and making them more strategic and reaction-based, which would give the game more of a teamwork appeal.)

What do you guys think? Do you think that Blizzard's approach to developing Starcraft 2 is a good one? What do you think they could be doing better?","Has Blizzard been doing a poor job at growing and maintaining Starcraft 2, compared to other competitive games?"
Games,"Personally I love it, I love Diablo like games and I'm a sucker for super heroes in gaming. You start with 5 or 6 heroes - I think it's Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Hulk, and Luke Cage. The game includes tons of groups, The avengers, X-men, Fantastic 4, Guardians of The Galaxy, not to mention villains like Venom, Juggernaut, Magneto, and a few other anti-heroes like Deadpool, Daredevil, and The Punisher.


Gameplay is like any Diablo-ish game, you get tons of loot, fighting off huge mobs of enemies, and fight bosses and do events around which ever map you're on. Armor doesn't show up on your character and instead you have skins which you can randomly earn as a rare drop or purchase with real money. Iron Man has the most with a ton of armor from the Mark I to the Hulkbuster to Movie armor.


All in all I enjoy the game and was wondering what other people thought of it.


Edit: Some misinformation there. You start with some heroes that you can only play until level 10, then you're allowed to fully unlock one of them. On the second day you log in you'll be granted 400 eternity splinters, which is the currency to buy heroes/team-ups. the recommended use for them is to buy random hero boxes for 175 splinters unless there is a character you just really want to play.

If you don't care about collecting things in the game, then don't, but to those who do, we lose a major point of enjoyment in games with loot.

Games,"I've always been a fan of 'owning' the games I buy, thus I would consider buying games from GoG or humble since the games are DRM free. However, due to the fact I'm living in Singapore, steam is cheaper for me compared to the above since steam has regional pricing for us. Thus I would be paying about 1.5x the price if I were to get it from humble or gog - assuming the discount was the same between all 3 stores. 

So this got me thinking, how much more are you guys willing to pay for a drm free version of a game compared to a steam/origin/uplay key? 
",How much more are you willing to spend on DRM free version of the games you want?
Games,"Does anybody here remember the Steam Workshop paid mods shitstorm?  Steam working alongside Bethesda decided that they would force monetization onto their Workshop creators which, as we know, killed the modding community by splitting modders and mod-ees down the line based on the opinion that wanting to create or enjoy mods for free makes you an ""entitled"" gamer.  It makes you wonder exactly why it is that Steam has been turning its head.  Now you begin to listen to those users who began to dislike and even hate Steam, stating that Valve-drones are now an existing group of rabid fans.


Valve has made this monstrous post and had openly stated that this isn't the last time they are going to try monetizing the Workshop and making money off of it.  The standard theory revolves around the factual conception of a purpose of a business.  These corporations whether EA's Origin or Valve's Steam are neither moral or immoral.  They are amoral, meaning that they do not care what is considered moral but what makes them money.  If a moral act makes them money, they will follow through with it and if an immoral act makes them money, they will follow through with attempting it.  I theorize that Valve has an insidious plot which I will delve into.


Now I believe that Valve are in the right on, at the very least, one recent issue.  At one point there was the $5 spent profile rule.  I think that this was actually a very good idea on Valve's part because of the fact that it prevents spam accounts from being created and shitting up the community, scamming dumb preteens who play TF2 and buy weapons in the Mann Co store.  It prevents people like Banana Who from generating fake hype and positive feedback by creating 60 accounts to revolutionize her game's store page, pun intended.  Any way possible that keeps the community as legitimate as possible is a desireable goal.


Steam is pushing the bar with what shitty practices they can possibly get away with from their paid mods scandal.  However I feel that they only got caught and I may know the next step of their master plan, albeit a nightmarishly worst-case scenario plan.  Over the years, Steam has granted us numerous games through their Steam sales, offering extremely rare discounts for AAA to indie all across the board for consumers of all wallet sizes to enjoy.  In no other corner of this or ANY industry could you find such outstanding deals.  This could have been merely a massive lure to bait us all.  Now, what do I mean by this?


What I mean is that Steam has dipped a gigantic lure into the pond and we fell for the bait.  We are now hooked with a massive backlog.  Our backlog is so large now that we have grown content with buying less games as a result of all that we now have.  There is little to no purpose today on Steam to buy more new games anyway.  Steam's quality control, as we all know, has been euthanized.  Anything can get on Steam except what people would actually like to see between the SJW bombing against games (Hatred) and the consumer demand being majorly overlooked.  Valve is making less money now than they have been because there is nothing we want to spend our money on even at these bi-annual discounts.


How else is Valve going to make its money?  Making videogames has long been out of the question.  Their lifeline stems from their digital distribution service.  Our lifeline stems from our backlog.  Valve sees that and can create these draconian business practices such as charging money for mods.  They can aggressively attack the foundations of what makes their service great, coercing gamers into falling in line because our backlogs are so large and even unplayed at times that we will say ""Please Valve, I'll do anything!  Just let me keep my backlog!""


They are at the point where they now hold power over gamers and can willingly exploit that.  What are they going to try next?  Are they going to charge money for adding friends?  Oh wait, they're already doing that with their trading card system.  Are they going to charge money for chat add-ons?  Oh wait, they're already doing that with emoticons.  Valve has us all by our balls from keeping hold of our backlogs and now revoking our CD keys if we don't play ball with developer EULAs.


Are they going to make Steam a paid-subscription service, thus making gamers pay monthly fees to keep their Steam account alive?  Valve could make an exorbitant amount of money by charging us money to be able to continue playing our backlog.  It would practically be extortion with some people paying more money for their larger backlogs.  This is my fear.  It may be considered an irrational fear, but what do you all think?  With how much bullshit the AAA gaming industry gets away with, I wouldn't be surprised if they took this inevitable step.  Rest assured, if it does happen I have GOG and am willing to try GOG Galaxy.  I have my Wii-U as well and am looking forward to Splatoon.  Emulators are eternal.

Games,"I haven't seen any game except America's Army 2 have a mechanic where your weapon could jam at rare and random times. Basically, your rifle might not fire and you'd have to press J to fix the jam (costing a few seconds and 1 bullet). 

While I get this presents problems in competitive games, I still find the mechanic interesting because it makes you cautious when it comes to closing with the enemy. I thought the mechanic was pretty unique and made a fairly realistic game even more authentic.

So my question is: Would you like it if more shooters had weapons that could jam? I'm honestly surprised that Red Orchestra doesn't have such a mechanic. 

EDIT: It seems like I forgot about Far Cry 2 and Fallout 3 &amp; NV. I guess the difference between what I was thinking about these games is that in AA it was so rare that it wasn't so much of a nuisance. I think there's a balance between novelty and functionality here

I didn't care about what consoles it came out on or if the graphics met my standards of what i thought ""next-gen"" was. I was just glad it was happening.But of course there were people complaining about everything they could point out.

It seems that no matter where you go now almost the entire gaming community is just a whirlwind of circle jerks. It seems no one can have a unique opinion anymore and they can't just enjoy games for games. It's all being taken way to seriously and is really disheartening to see. I don't understand why we argue about what console is better or about if PC is better than console and if the ""next-gen"" consoles are truly ""next-gen"". I just wish we could forget that and focus on what we have in front of us. Games. They are games after all.

Games,"Games, like every form of art, have a valued history. Just as there could not have been a Monty Python without the Marx Brothers or Wall-E without Toy Story, there could not have been a shooter genre without Doom or a stealth genre without Metal Gear. But with games, we can project this even more vividly. Thanks to the nature of the art form as it was raised in the information age, we can trace back subgenres and ""family trees"" of which games pioneered which designs and mechanics and methods of storytelling. Resident Evil 4 popularized the over-the-shoulder camera, Half-Life 2 reinvented the idea of the physics engine, Symphony of the Night christened the Metroidvania genre and World of Warcraft turned the MMO market into a titan. We can not only look back at these games and still enjoy (most) of them, we can learn from them; we can learn from their failings and successes both, and try to improve the industry today.

And now we can't.

The eradication of backwards compatibility these past few generations is, in my belief, one of the most horrible ideas in the game industry in recent memory. There have been consoles in the past that were not backwards compatible, but now that the console market is the smallest it's been in terms of choice since the old Atari days (with only three viable choices), this has become more prevalent. Since video games move so quickly from console to console (where the VCR was the go-to home video player from 1970-2000, video game consoles went through *six generations* of hardware change in the same timespan, and moved from cassettes to floppies to cartridges to CDs), cataloguing their record is even harder. But Sony and Microsoft have made the decision that it's no longer important to even *attempt* to maintain the historical record of the PS2 and Xbox 360, which brought us such landmark games as Shadow of the Colossus, Silent Hill 2, BioShock, Mass Effect and Psychonauts, and because the publishers hold *all the power* in this industry, we now have to rely on nothing more than their good will to port those old games over to the new generations with flashy new graphics. On top of *that*, we have the ESA [claiming that trying to get abandonware servers online is illegal](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/publishers-fight-to-block-third-party-revival-of-abandoned-game-servers/) and further obstructing people from playing old games.

In my mind, the preservation of old games (with their original graphics, mind you; those are important for historical context) *should* be priority one. If you can't do it, **do not make** a new console. Full stop, the end. This is important because every piece of art in this tower builds on another piece; if the English language was completely rewritten and retooled every five or six years and everything we wrote previously was incomprehensible, can you imagine what our literary history would look like? In my eyes, new consoles should function as an *upgrade* for the original material, not a *replacement* for them. Because it simply makes no sense for Sony or Microsoft to take away the consoles with hundreds of games and give us new ones with no games and tell us that's an improvement. That's simply dumb.

History is important, and given how fast this medium moves, I'd argue that it's more important here than it any other form of art; we will and already have repeated the lessons and failings of the past if we don't remember them, more times than I can count. And if publishers can't recognize that and would rather simply forget about every great thing they and all of us made ten years prior, then I weep for us and I weep for this medium.

Games,"So for the past few weeks I've been finding myself getting kinda bored with my usual games. I've tried playing new stuff and various f2p games and games in my backlog that I've never finished, yet I've found myself getting bored with all of them, and as a result my steam history is filled with ""0.4 hours past two weeks"", ""1 hour past two weeks"", etc. Nothing has been able to hold my attention or enthusiasm, despite the occasional Hearthstone run or Tf2 session. I've been wondering why this has been happening, because I love video games and am usually an avid gamer. However the past few weeks have been different from most of my time spent gaming: I've been playing games by myself.

Usually, I'll hop on a skype call with 3-4 of my friends and we'll all play some game or other. We can be playing the biggest piece of shit game and it'll still be a great time. Some of my most fun experiences in gaming are the four hour long skype sessions where we are all just fucking around doing stupid shit in whatever game. 

I played Guns of Icarus with a friend of mine a day ago, a game we hadn't touched in months, and while we got our asses kicked, it was still an awesome time. Playing games by myself just feels, empty. While I've been playing TF2 and CS:GO a bunch, despite the fact that these games are online multiplayer, they feel lonley and I end up just clicking heads aimlessly. 

I suppose this is why I've been searching for a great mmo lately. Human interaction. Yeah you can start a conga line in TF2 or coordinate with your team in CS but that sense of brotherhood I often see associated with MMO's is what I've been lacking in gaming for the past couple of weeks. I haven't really found an mmo I can mesh with, so my gaming time has been spent fairly aimlessly.

It's not like my friend group and I are adults with families or anything, all of us are 16-17 and our summer breaks just started, so I thought that our gaming time would increase, but the opposite's been true.

My bad for thinking the fan base of this game might be interested in a different insight and my bad at getting excited because SE directly addressed the fans, the ones who kept the game alive.  

Must suck to live life that pessimistically. 

** I think I just decoded the FF7 trailer everyone.**  I know what the references to the promise and the reunion mean.  **It is not necessarily about the story of FF7 but all about them listening to the fans FINALLY and remaking the game**... and they are telling us they were sorry and the game is being remade because of us, the fans.   That we were vocal, passionate, and freaking stubborn enough to finally get through to them.  

**I believe the entire trailer is a giant apology to the fans from the SE team.** 

I belive the story will remain the same.  They will not add to it, this will not be a quasi sequel, nothing... because those references were to honor the fans themselves, not give clues to the game.   

Check it out... Here is it broken down with explanations, the text from the trailer, and what was going on in the background.  

***********************************************************
0:10 - *""Long ago we looked upon a foreboding sky""* 

0:15 - *""the memory of the star that threatened all""* - **Threatened all, as in all the people inside the universe of the game.  He never says ""threatened US all"", which tells me its possible the speaker is not a character in game talking about his experiences, he is talking directly to us, the fans.** 

***********************************************************
 
0:20 - *""burns eternal in our hearts""* after this statement we see the first true clues... **seventh gate** and the **playground** at 0:25.  Recognizable music starts playing right as the girl slides down the slide we all remember.  2 boys are playing in the background with what looks like replica buster swords. 

**This is significant because they are giving us sentimental clues and referencing how it burns eternal in our hearts, the hearts of the fans.  We kept the memory of the game alive.**    

***********************************************************

0:27 - *""in its wake came an aaage of silence""*  followed immediately by a credit scene at 0:32 - Producer Yoshinori Kitase - The Director of FF7.  **This is a reference to years of silence regarding sequels/remakes even though fans wanted it. Also note the word age is drawn out as if to say ""we get it, its been a long freaking time""**  

&amp;nbsp; 

0:34 -  *""Yet with each fond remembrance, we knew.  Those encountered were not forgotten.""* background Midgar, super recognizable.  

**We being the FF7 executive team.  ""Those"" being the vocal fans.**  This statement is made when the executive team is being credited, thus solidifying the ""we"" reference. 

Followed by a fan favorite part of the sountrack with ""Scenario - Kazushige Nojima""...  who was a writer on FF7 **but wait, theres more** 

&amp;nbsp;  

0:46: *""That someday we would see them again""* followed at 0:47 of the infamous flower.  **The above writer was the one who suggested one of the female leads die.  He is referenced and then they reference the character he killed off, a character we have all wanted to see again.** 

&amp;nbsp;  


0:50: *""Perhaps it was no more than wishful thinking""*  

0:54 The screen says ""Director Tetsuya Nomura"" - **He directed Advent Children which many fans were completely disappointed about. So we saw the characters again but it was not what everyone had hoped for.** 

*********************************************************** 

1:00 - *""But after the long calm, there are now the beginnings of a stir""*.  **The FANS were speaking up and demanding what they wanted to the point SE was going downhill fast.  No one trusted them anymore.**  

&amp;nbsp; 

1:07: As the camera is flying through the slums to eventually focus in on Barret and Cloud... *""The reunion at hand may bring joy, it may bring fear, but let us embrace whatever it brings.""*  This statement finishes up at 1:16 when the original opening theme music starts.

&amp;nbsp; 

**The Reunion is not the reunion from the game, but the reunion of the fans and the characters**.  All remakes/sequels have people who are pumped and those who are scared.  **They are saying ""we get it, what we did sucked.  We are sorry. Give us a chance to bring us what you want and see if you can embrace it again.** 

&amp;nbsp; 

1:18 Barret enters frame.  

&amp;nbsp; 

1:20: *""For they are coming back.""* **As soon the speaker starts the phrase coming back cloud enters the screen and the music is now unmistakable.**  

&amp;nbsp; 

1:25: *""At last the promise has been made""*.  **Because they said they were NOT going to remake it because it would be too much money but they are FINALLY making the promise to us, the fans, that they are finally doing what was asked of them**

While playing fallout, i felt ""this game needs more action"" and while watching mad max, i felt ""whoa they need to tone down the action"" and RAGE delivered the perfect combo.

So i feel, if bethesda worked with id software for another RAGE game, inspired by fallout in the same universe, it really could be one of the greats. What do you guys think?

EDIT: Reading into it a bit, turns out RAGE and fallout are in the same universe anyway, so bethesda &amp; ID Software could use that to their advantage to promote RAGE and fallout and the same time",How would you guys feel about another RAGE game?

Games,"Hello all,

Now I know that TESO had a terrible launch. A lot of major reviewers, such as Angry Joe, disliked the game quite a bit when it first came out. I actually completely agree with them; from what my friends said and from what I saw of the game, it appeared to be just... well, mediocre.

Imagine my surprise when I found a vibrant community and a vastly improved game when I first played it in June. Here's some of the reasons as to why I like it so much, (and also the things I don't like so much.)

**Crime system**

The crime system is really, really fun. You can sneak into a store and steal the shopkeeper's items, just like in previous Elder Scrolls titles. You can make these items no longer appear stolen by running to the local underground base for thieves in town, which makes for some frantic guard escapes. You can also pickpocket people. It may not sound like much to an Elder Scrolls fan, but it makes quite the difference when you're playing it.

 **The quests.**

Every single quest I've done is voice acted, which can be rather hit and miss, sadly. However, at least on the Aldemeri Dominion side, the quests are fun and varied. I've been knocked out, thrown in jail, assassinated would-be queen killers, and ventured into the minds of spirits to rid them of anger, temptation, etc.

There are certainly some boring, generic MMO quests, (and this is coming from a huge fan of World of Warcraft), but the majority of quests I've done are just entertaining.

**The combat.**

The combat has apparently improved since launch. Apparently it used to feel clunky, but, while there is still some clunkiness, it's really fun! Playing as a Nightblade is interactive and entertaining. The fact that **all classes can use all weapons** is fantastic, original, and a huge gameplay changer.

**Group play is vastly improved.**

In reviews such as Angry Joe's, the group play was pointed out as, well, abysmal at launch. It was pathetic for an MMO, but, thankfully, the devs have worked on it quite a bit. Group play is now relatively encouraged, and I always have fun running groups with randoms or friends.

**The developers.**

The developers are passionate, and committed to making the game the best it can be. They're active on the forums, and have great communication; something that the developers of my other favorite MMO, Blizzard, have been failing to do as of late. It just highlights how important communication between the consumer and the developer is.

**The price model.**

I personally believe that B2P is the way to go for MMOs. It doesn't drain your wallet, and just works! 

**The community.**

As with most online games, there are some huge jerks online. However, the vast majority of players I've run into have been helpful and fun to play with. Zone chat the other day was just everyone either helping each other out, or saying the guard quotes from Skyrim back and forth.

**The PvP.**

I haven't played much of this yet, I'll admit, but all my friends adore it. The battles I have been in are tactical, bombastic, and just damn fun. Sieging a castle in TESO is just as fun as running with a group in WvW in Guild Wars 2. It's unique, fleshed out, and entertaining as hell to play.

**The Problems with the game**

Just one of my problems with the game is that, in my opinion, the Ebonheart Pact has a terrible opening zone. Getting to level 10 was almost impossible, due to how boring and bland the world was. Roll another faction; just my opinion though.

Another is the voice acting. It ranges from charismatic and humorous, to lifeless and cringeworthy. It really is a mixed bag.

My last, and probably most prominent issue with the game is its overall story... it's just not very engaging, in my opinion. It's predictable. Thankfully, there's plenty of fascinating lore scattered all over the world to find out more about Tamriel at that time.

All in all, I feel like everyone should give The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited a second chance. It boasts a vibrant, active community and loads of content. I just can't believe it used to be so terrible. Don't get me wrong; it's still littered with problems, but with developers so determined to make the game better, I'm very hopeful for the future of the game.

That's my two cents. What does everyone else think of the game?
","I'm new to The Elder Scrolls Online, and I'm loving it. Here's why you should give it another shot."
Games,"According to [this facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/lcpdfr/posts/864712593623043) by the creators of the LCPDFR mod for GTA V, Rockstar recently implemented anti-modding or anti-hacking measures which negatively impacted the performance of the game's scripting system, used extensively by both the vanilla game and by mods.

The previous thread got removed for ""unsubstantiated rumours"", so I'd like to gives some evidence here. The Rockstar support website lists a [heavily upvoted issue concerning the performance concerns](https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206862727), and anyone who's played the game recently can attest to the severe performance concerns.

On the technical side the game internally uses heavy scripting even without mods, as it is what separates the gameplay code from the engine-level code - so assuming the creators of LCPDFR are correct, both the vanilla game and mods will be heavily affected, as they both go through the same function calls and pipeline to communicate with the engine.

The usage of these scripting functions in modding probably isn't actually intended by Rockstar, which is why to use mods you must install a scripthook which essentially tells the mods where to find the scripting functions to use. In fact, to create a scripthook actually requires reverse-engineering the game's binary .dll files. 

Assuming it is true, the increased complexity and ""dead code"" is may be part of efforts to try and reduce modding and/or hacking, as the scripthooks cannot be created as easily - the modders reverse-engineering the game cannot easily tell what code is critical and what code is ""dead"".

Rockstar report to be looking into these performance concerns, but have given no further information on what could've caused these issues. Before jumping to conclusions, it may be intelligent to wait for their response (if any).

Just to clarify, the performance downgrade happens **even if you have no mods installed**.

EDIT:

The developers of LCPDFR recently released this: http://www.lcpdfr.com/forums/topic/52152-lspdfr-02-update-12-july/

Script performance was **five times slower** in the current build than with the older one, so it's certainly no placebo/nocebo.

EDIT 2:

The lead developer of LSPDFR posted this:

&gt; LMS here, lead developer of LCPDFR/LSPDFR. A quick performance test I ran yesterday which shows the problem: http://pastebin.com/Gz7RYE61 There is no distinction between calling this from a mod or normal game code, it will always perform worse compared to earlier versions.

Games,"What did everyone think of this game? Truthfully I liked it more than the dark descent, my reasoning:

- while the plot is confusing as hell, it is much more symbolic and gave me more to think about and walk away with

- the Dark Descent definitely had some better scares, but I found this one to be far more disturbing. The ending where the pigs go out into the world is pretty dark

- I absolutely love the atmosphere and all the creepy industrial scenery. To me the castle seemed creepy, but kind of a generic setting. 

- I do think that the game decreased in quality towards the middle sections, but the beginning I found to be pretty dark. With the whole weird pervy bathtub room and all that

Games,"The first game I saw that really caught my interest regarding this problem was this: [""Devils Share""](http://store.steampowered.com/app/388870/). More recently, [this one](http://store.steampowered.com/app/392870/) also appeared. They are featured as ""New on Steam"", are incredibly cheap (and cheaply made), and have overwhelmingly negative reviews. 

At first glance, I'm inclined to believe it is just some super low quality or low experience developer who is looking to make a quick couple bucks off a couple small games. This seems like a bad thing, because I don't want some greedy and half assed developer getting front page status on Steam when there are plenty of other indie games to advertise.

But then I'm also wondering if projects like these are somebody's genuine first attempt at a game that they wish to release on Steam. The more recent title is on sale for 25 cents, and Devils Share was as well when it was on the front page, and ironically, many of the Steam reviews say that they got their money's worth, which I guess is arguably acceptable -- a 25 cent game can't possibly be very fantastic.

My main question though is whether these titles should be allowed to be featured on the front page when they are of a massively lower quality compared even to other popular indie games on Steam. My personal take is that it feels like sort of a slimy cash grab attempt trying to get shoppers in the mindset of ""Oh it's only 25 cents, how bad could it be?""

Also, do extremely cheap games like these bring Steam closer to iOS and Google app stores, which have serious problems with low quality apps being sold in an attempt to trick or mislead customers?

Edit: just as a third example, here's another one I just noticed after posting this: [Call of Tomsk-7](http://store.steampowered.com/app/390660/). As far as reviews go, it has an 86% approval rate, but the ""most helpful"" reviews all tend to be thumbs down.

Games,"**/u/Tmoney34: Last time we talked, you announced that you're moving to the Infusion engine, which was going to be modularly added into the existing game. How much progress would you say you've made on that with development?**

**Brian Hicks:** A lot of that stuff, obviously, the consumers aren't going to see, because anything that's not called player-ready is kept in its own branch so it's not to interrupt the gameplay. At this point, we started with Real Virtuality as a tech, and then when we started to look at doing our own engine, Infusion, it was a matter of looking at tech we needed for Real Virtuality, tech we needed for Enforce, which is the Take on Mars engine, and then stuff that we would need ourselves that just didn't exist yet. Bringing all this technology together, and then at the end of development, we would have Infusion, our engine designed for the type of game DayZ is. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I don't want to give a rough percentage, we're millions of lines of code different from RV at this point. We couldn't be called Real Virtuality anymore. Sure, we still have some of the tech debt, with some major issues that we haven't replaced, player controller, animation system, original physics system, stuff that's all either actively being developed to be replaced or soon to be replaced either way. I say we still got probably got a year until, I think, right about our release from early access, about a year until I think I can safely say we're starting to see Infusion instead of hybrid bits of Infusion and Real Virtuality. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's got to be probably the most challenging part of our early access is trying to do this engine development while allowing people to have access to the builds coming out. It means, a lot of times, the programmer's got to sit on their own branch and wait for us to release the build before they can merge in, and then the second they merge into the main trunk, it just breaks everything. We've got to spend weeks upon weeks making sure everything works properly, fixing the bugs until we can, again, get to a build in which we can hand to consumers. A good example of this would be looking at .57 when we merged in the new inventory tech. Once .55 went out, the programer working on that, merged this stuff over, and just everything broke. It was just a mess. This is a brand-new inventory tech coming. We looked at the original system that we had coming from RV and said, ""Some of this works for us but a lot of it needs to be changed in order to meet what we need from the tech of the future."" 

**/u/cbit: Has the vision the game has changed in any way since development began and if so, could you explain a bit?**


**Brian Hicks:** From the point that we entered active development is about early September, 2013. I'd say, obviously, the most noticeable scope change was when Dean first started talking about we've decided we're actually going to, instead of just keep modifying Real Virtuality, we're going to go and make Infusion. Scope changes such as the new renderer, and then we look at the new animation system, the new player controls, the new physics system, the vehicle simulation plugged into this new physics system. Most of that scope change occurred very early in the project. We're talking early 2014, very early on scope changes. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I wouldn't necessarily define it as a scope change, but a lot of systems are adapted based upon how we see people react to them in an early access on stable and experimental branches. Initially, I think since none of us, both consumer and developers, really knew exactly what to expect from this concept of going into early access three months into a principal development what that meant. It was untouched territory.

**/u/Tmoney34: Especially when you compare the game to other early access titles like Mincecraft, there is just so much more going on.** 

**Brian Hicks:** Again, it's not just scope of their titles, but how they approached early success, how we approach early access. In my experience, sure, there's similar milestones in game development that can be shared across those projects, but no one project is the same as the next. The issues you'll run into one game are going to be completely different from the next. Our challenges, technology-wise, are going to be different from theirs, obviously, but I think all developers that deal with early access share both the burden and the blessing from it. Burden being that our cycle and how you push builds out, and how much time you spend pseudo-mastering development builds. That's definitely something that takes time getting used to. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then again, early access, you look and you pair early access development with this new connected social Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and so on and so forth. It is an unparalleled blessing that we can interact with our consumers so quickly. Look, I was talking to Dallas over at Portalarium a couple of days ago, stopped by to have lunch and check out their studios. I'm big fan of Shroud of the Avatar and he mentioned to me how amazed and passionate he is about the fact that you look at development now, early access and all this connected stuff versus how it was when he first got into the industry back in the early year, the beginning of Origin. They'd spend years working on a project and then ship it to the retailer. They really never get a chance to interact with their fans except for maybe if they did a signing or something. That was about it. Maybe fan letters. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We get instant feedback on what does and does not work, and we've adapted, it's taken us time getting used to this, but we started more and more to adapt to rapidly responding to what the consumer wants. Obviously, we do have to maintain the focus of what the game is, but I think there's room in there to adapt the mechanics and how they are based upon how players either use them or don't. 

**/u/danj503 What kind of ""situational awareness"" features are going to be added in the future?** 

**Brian Hicks:** I think there might be an opportunity for some forester/hunter skills based upon tracking, but when it comes to raw situational awareness, we should never start to stick our noses in where a player's eyes and personal skill and situation comes into play. I think it's one of those things you see some of the more PvP-oriented players, they really know how to move in, in between the bushes. They know what areas to watch, their eyes are really attuned to the tactical scenario. We should never mess with that. Nothing a designer can do can really ever supplant the feeling those players get from their own personal skill winning out. We should never mess with that. 

**/u/capri_stylee: Are there any plans to flesh out the melee combat?**

**Brian Hicks:** Obviously, we need to expand upon the melee system. Right now, the way it works is fine for early access, but we want to see a lot of polish come into it. It would be nice to see if we can do blocking. At a base level, we should be able to, should be able to, but it's going to require some tech analysis, and we'll probably want to look at fleshing out melee. We'll probably talk about this more in status reports, like evaluating how it operates right now, what we think we can do within the system. I guess the short answer to it is we'd like to but we're going to have to see exactly how much time it would take on development side and what the risks might be going into it.

/u/ace402: What will the limitations of modding be?

**Brian Hicks:** There's a lot of this we haven't talked about yet, and that's specifically because we haven't finalized exactly how we want it to work. Eugene, my associate producer, brought this up to me the other day, and it didn't even cross my min. Once we release the server binaries for people to host their own servers, which, of course, will come into play for people who's into mods, unless we want to manage a significant amount of time in how people access the back end and what kind of access they get, we should probably really look into in addition to push out server package, pushing out some form of our back end for people who want to run their own stuff. I don't think it's feasible for us to try and manage all this stuff in the long run, so when it comes to looking into, I feel like this is more of a server-specific question, but when it comes into looking at how server hosting is handled and releasing the server package, we have to look at it from a perspective of longevity. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It might seem like a good idea and easier for us right now to manage all this stuff and keep it controlled, but in the long term, I personally want to see DayZ have legs of five to ten years. Maybe ten is a little lofty but five years at least. In order to do that, you need to be realistic about the resources on a personal level that we would have to dedicate to it. We need to look at opening up as much as we can while still protecting, of course, the base game and the technology behind it.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;More than likely, and this isn't finalized, more than likely look at a hive package, as well, for people to go out and set up their own database. People want to do that. There are people that don't, they want to be on our tech, then we'll look at, for the private charge, look at opening up access to their own control over their economies, and for the public, obviously, we'll have to keep that further restricted to the public hive is always to be the vision that the developers have. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That will probably end up being that as modding goes out, more people will host modding servers. It means we'll have to pay to host more official servers, but I think it's very important that we do that, that there will always be the first thing people experience when they get in game, when they hit play in DayZ is the first thing they see is a list of official servers, the ones that the developers have full control over and match DayZ exactly. If they want to dive in to that custom stuff, there should be a tab or a couple of tabs with community and mod servers so they can go over there. For those that don't know what they're diving into, should be really easy to get into the official DayZ experience. 

**/u/Solocov: Do you plan on creating a little backstory for the virus, like newspapers, movies, articles, grave yards, evacuation zones etc?**

**Brian Hicks:** We're very reluctant to define what the Chernarus experience is on a narrative side. We'll tell small stories with scenes, like in the woods, you come up to the car that's wrecked in a ditch and maybe we'll put some corpses around that. We'll set up these military bases that seem to look like there was an impromptu evacuation set up. We don't really want to take it much further than that. We think the narrative of what DayZ is, is up to the player, honestly.

**/u/Neemz1844: What future feature do you think the community will be the most impressed with?**

**Brian Hicks:** Honestly, if we're going to be straight up honest, I think the community will be most impressed when we get server performance operating well above the redline with 100 players and a couple thousand infected, and desync is significantly less of a problem. That's what people will be impressed by. 

**/u/Tmoney34: I skipped over the question because I think you touched on it with having thousands of zombies. I take it that means hordes at some point will at least be attempted?**

**Brian Hicks:** They will definitely be attempted. I'm pretty confident we have the tech to do it. Right now, it's just a matter of, A, finalizing the bugs on herd mentality, and, B, optimizing the performance cost of the infected. Then we can start screwing around and spawning hordes. 

**/u/horrorview: Do you still think the game will be ""feature complete"" by the end of this calendar year?**

**Brian Hicks:** When you say feature complete, it means the implementation of these features, the first, the basic flesh out, as we say, that's the first iteration of vehicles. I still think we have a good chance of by the end of this year, being in what we consider beta, which is where we stop focusing so much on core features and switching to bug fixing and small content. I still think there's a good chance, and there's also a chance that end up pushed out a couple of months, but I don't think we're looking at any severe delays. I think, all in all, when you look at the scope of the project, we were looking at originally a 2.5 to 3-year development cycle. I think if we don't hit that 3-year, we're going to be damn close, I honestly believe so.

**/u/tmoney34: . The final release is coming 1.0 at some point. Do you see yourself adopting more of the Minecraft model of 1.0 happens and then we just keep going on? Or do you see it more as we hit 1.0, the game is done, we're going to continue to support it with patches and bug fixes, but do you see the content continuing to trickle out after that?**

**Brian Hicks:** What the company does is not specifically up to me, but I and I believe Mark, the CEO, both agree on this, is the development continues on DayZ long past 1.0. I'm not talking just bug fixes. We'll flesh out more types of vehicles, we'll implement things that we might not have been able to get to in the early access development. We will continue, but hear me, we'll continue developing DayZ past 1.0. How far past 1.0? I don't know, but I know when I've spoken to Mark, he was passionate about at least two to five years.

Games,"(Ok! Trying this again now that I've proved I'm me. Once more, with feeling:)

I've been making games for over twenty years, but my biggest claim to fame - and some people are getting sick of hearing me say this - is that I was the guy who originally prototyped and oversaw the development of the swinging gameplay in *Spider-Man 2*.

After *Spider-Man 2* I went indie and made *Schizoid* for XBLA and a couple of other projects that, for various reasons (involving publishers), were never finished.

So I decided to see what I could do on my own, and started making *Energy Hook*. *Energy Hook* is an extreme sports game like *Tony Hawk* or *SSX*, but instead of skating or snowboarding you're swinging from building to building, running on walls, and doing aerial tricks and flips. It's the extreme sport of the future!

After an unorthodox Kickstarter where I had a $1 funding goal and raised over $40k (and made it into the Videogame Edition of Guinness for 'highest percentage funded'!) - and after taking a break for a few months to make Sixty Second Shooter Prime for the Xbox One - I've finally released it on Steam, as an Early Access game. 

I've never worked on a game this long; never put so much of myself into a single game! It's exciting and terrifying.

&gt; Forza Motorsport 6 will to appeal to a lot of gamers, whether they be casual or serious racing fans. But more than any one group, FM6 going to lure in those who were disappointed by Forza 5. This is a far more complete, entertaining, and engaging game in every way. Not only does it finally deliver a reasonable car and track listing, but it offers a wide variety of experiences outside of the career aspect. There's still room for improvement, but you'll be hard pressed to find another title that can so easily suck in hours and hours of your day.

&gt;For me though, it was enough to outright bring me back into the racing fold. I found myself racing for hours, racking up credits, ferociously buying new cars to add to my garage, and cursing at my friend's Drivatars. Forza 6 is the new king of simulation racing.

&gt;Forza Motorsport 6 is a welcome shot in the arm for the series. Easily the best entry the franchise has produced, Forza 6 introduces tons of new online and offline gameplay that should make players want to stay in the driver’s seat for as long as possible this fall.

&gt;It's not a contradiction that Forza 6 is as fun as it is disappointing. Its faults and omissions do not make it a bad game or one that veers dramatically from the franchise's path. But what exactly is the series' philosophy? We've seen the career mode change from iteration to iteration, with the developer unable to define where it wants to go and therefore build upon a foundation in successive years. Turn 10 talks about its passion for cars, and that's evident on the track, but players have to feel it elsewhere, too.

&gt;This is a true showcase for Xbox One in every area except the racing. Inconsistent difficulty, random payouts and way too many dull events seriously spoil the party.

&gt;As merely the second installment for the Xbox One, Forza Motorsport 6 not only keeps up with the high bar set by Forza 5, it capitalizes on that foundation of quality. The Mod system and the weather effects are reasons enough for Forza 5 enthusiasts to seriously consider this sequel and the abundance of difficulty and assist options makes Forza 6 an immensely accessible driving simulation for newcomers.

&gt;Like a big bucket of Hot Wheels brought to life, Forza Motorsport 6 is first-order car porn for the automobile obsessed but remains an accessible and exciting racer for those who just want to drive fast in something red with a horse logo on it. It’s spinning its wheels in a few areas but what’s here is undoubtedly some of the finest racing you can find on console and easily worth the upgrade from Forza 5.

&gt;With the loss of some of its personality, Forza Motorsport 6 sometimes feels like a little less than the sum of many much improved parts, and there are certain quality-of-life changes that feel increasingly overdue. But these are only distractions, bumps in the road that make Forza feel ""just"" great when looked at from a distance. And in the playing, Turn 10 feels like it's found its line even more effectively.

&gt;Forza Motorsport 6 is what I always wanted a next-gen driving game to be. It offers beautiful visuals, a wide variety of options, and uses real-world physics to dictate how vehicles perform. I could easily see myself playing Forza 6 for several months, or even years. I've never experienced a driving game with this level of polish, and it's unlikely anything will unseat it in the near future.

Games,"One of my biggest pet peeves in gaming is when I feel forced to replay content I already mastered in order to get to the part I actually struggled at. Sort of applies to ""Game Overs"" and many devs use it to increase total playtime.

I played Demon's Souls a few years back and I finished it after about 50 hours. I realized that the amount of content of the game wasn't even that much...I felt that most of my play time was spent traveling all the way to where I needed to be because there was rarely any checkpoint or shortcut which meant that dying was very punishing.

Same formula applies to Dark Souls which I just finished today. It's more lenient with he checkpoints but still few and far between. Every time I die, I don't think ""what could I have done better?"", instead I think ""Great, now I'm gonna have to run all the way back here, and defeat every monster that was in my way again."" This game gets praised for the difficulty. But is that supposed to be part of the challenge? Constantly walking the same long paths because you keep dying and have almost no checkpoints in between?

I understand why it's done at certain times. For example, the Catacombs are not a recommended place to start your first play-through. It's a long dark path full of skeletons who reassemble when you kill them. It gets tedious having to try over and over but as the player, you're supposed to get the hint that you're not supposed to go there yet. However, most of the time, when I only have one specific boss to kill to progress, it still forces me to walk long distance to get to the bosses. Why not put a bonfire right before the boss? It just feels tedious, and makes me want to put the game down.

Love the souls series so far and I already know DS2 will do the same because people praise the difficulty but is this really fair? Or just punishing?

TL;DR: Dark Souls punishes you by redoing a lot of content before retying the part where you actually failed at. Is this fair and part of the challenge? Or just pointless punishment?

[Bracket for the event](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2015_Red_Bull_Battle_Grounds:_Washington)

**On Archon Mode:**

One of the most exciting new features of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is the **Archon Mode**, a mode that allows multiple players to control a single base. It was seen back in the original StarCraft, but was not popularized or supported by ladder like it is now. In the current Legacy of the Void beta, Archon Mode is playable on ranked ladder in 2v2 format, meaning that two players control each base, though in custom games you can have more than that (e.g. four players controlling a single base).

**Tournament Format:**

The tournament is played with two players controlling each base, like standard Archon Mode ladder. The upper bracket matches are best of five (first Archon to reach 3 map wins) and the lower bracket matches are best of three (first to 2 map wins). The finals are a best of five, which if won by the team coming from the lower bracket goes into a best of three.

**The Tournament Series So Far:**

The Red Bull Battle Grounds (RBBG) 2015 tournament series consists of RBBG Toronto, RBBG Santa Monica, and RBBG Washington (the Grand Finals). Additionally, the Santa Monica event was preceded by six online qualifiers. 

The Grand Finals event consists of **four teams**. First, you have **Bomber and MMA (T)**, who were invited to the event thanks to Bomber winning the RBBG 2014 tournament series. Second, you have **Violet and MaSa (Z/T)**, who won the RBBG Toronto event. Third and fourth are the teams **HuK and MC (P)** and **DongRaeGu and True (Z)**, who took first and second place in the RBBG Santa Monica tournament. These four teams are playing for their share of a $30,000 prize pool.

Games,"Hi Reddit,

This original post from /u/iChrisse inspired me to start playing Wolfenstein Enemy Territory again and I have joined others playing on a regular basis with 50+ players on some of FA's servers. I thought I'd re-post it for others to follow suit since this game had (has) a huge following.

Wolfenstein: Enemy territory is a FPS game From the early 2000's. Here a short gameplay vid ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gx7dcXgnqQ). It's a skill based, low damage per projectile shooter. Also low recoil. It has the best team work of any game I have played.

Many people will already know the game. Since Punkbuster stopped supporting the game it has been harder to install and set up so here I go.

First I will explain install process, afterwards little explanation of the game.

    First download the game. Here (http://returntocastlewolfenstein.filefront.com/file/Enemy_Territory;14380#Download)

    Install to where you want it.

    Download Patch #1 Here (http://returntocastlewolfenstein.filefront.com/file/ET_Patch_Windows;39483#Download)

    Run patch

    Download second patch Here (http://returntocastlewolfenstein.filefront.com/file/Wolfenstein_Enemy_Territory_260b_Patch_win32;62012#Download)

    Place files from second patch in you wolfenstein: ET folder.

    Normally for win32, if you use 64 just run in admin which should make it work.

    Go to ETkey.org

    download ETkey and put it in your Wolfenstein/etmain folder + if using other Os than xp: http://i.imgur.com/GsSiPty.png

    Now you should be able to play!

Some extra info

If you join a server it might download some files, wait for it to be done, they are mods, maps or other stuff.

http://et.trackbase.net/serverlist/ Here you can see servers which have humans playin on them. Some servers have a lot of bots. They are nice to practise on but not if you want to play a lot.

Ingame press L to open ""Limbo menu"". Here you can select your class and weapon and spawn. Also change your name.

First thing you should do when entering a game is: Open cosole (~) or (²) and enter:

/seta cl_maxpackets 100

&amp;

/rate 40000

Hope this might have helped for some and see you online!

Thank you for this! Please tell your friends or gaming friends to install again and start playing!

Games,"We've seen hints of this in the past, UbiArt Framework allowed Rayman to come back to consoles with a lower budget, but a clearly passionate team - I think the industry could extend this to so many unused or middle-tier (in terms of profit) IP's, allowing indie developers to make a name for themselves, on the backs of popular IP's that could easily succeed with a passionate team behind the project. 

I'm not saying the single/double A games of old franchises are necessarily bad, but clearly they are restricted heavily by production budget and bloated publisher system. 

Here's an example of what could work:

Activision gives the license to make a Spyro game to a small indie developer, they produce a $20 game that uses low-poly stylized graphics, HD resolution and SSAO/shaders (Imagine this uprezzed with modern graphical shading, but a similar style and the beautiful simple look: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spyro/images/b/b3/Artisans.png/revision/latest?cb=20130108055007)

(this is what emulation mods can do, imagine if it was built from the ground up? https://youtu.be/baE312QM5R0?t=2m15s [""before"" comparison at start of video])

There are surely a lot of developers who are passionate about old franchises that could do this. 

We see another example with the new kings quest, it's a stylized game that looks beautiful, but it also looks like the team were prudent and smart about what they chose to refine. The developer is also a passionate fan of the original series.

I've seen similar ideas tossed around in the past, which is why I've also come to this conclusion, but what do you think?","Higher production budgets are pushing many smaller IP's out of the gaming sphere. Publishers should give these IP's to smaller, hungry developers to make indie games."
Games,"**Tl;dr- If you want to play the Wildstar now that it has gone free-to-play you are likely going to have to wait a while for a series of issues to be resolved**

This is just a general post to notify anyone not on /r/WildStar (who was thinking about playing it now that it had gone F2P) that the launch event is going very poorly according to many user reports. The US megaserver Entity and the PvP server sometimes, are essentially freezing when you finish character creation. EU players are reporting a similar problem. Carbine has said this is only during peak hours but other users have said that it is occurring at not-peak hours (early hours of the morning, mostly). When the game basically freezes it still seems to have the ability to kick you from the client for inactivity (since when you create the character you can't click anything or do anything). Some users have reported that their characters are appearing selectable hours or a day after they created them. Other users are reporting that they are not appearing at all, up to 48 hours later.

Reports from inside the game say it is a laggy mess because obviously the servers are overloaded during the launch event (like many MMOs at launch).",The Wildstar Free-to-play re-launch is having some issues

I was hoping to start a real discussion around the dollar, however, but please feel free to mention other currencies as well.

-------------------------------

I've been wondering about this for a while... The last big ""price hike"" was from $50 USD --&gt; $60 USD in 2004/2005 ([source](http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/29/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/)).

Using a [simple inflation calculator](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=60.00&amp;year1=2005&amp;year2=2015), $60 USD in 2005 is approximately equal to $73.22 today.

Personally, I feel like a big reason we haven't seen prices go up is because of the introduction of DLC and alternative business models. But at the same time, it's interesting that inflation hasn't won out this round. I've been expecting 2016 to be ""the year"" that raises prices, but as the early pre-order campaigns roll in for Q1, we're still seeing that $60 USD price point.

3. How is the unlocking system?

5. Is the game well balanced?

Games,"I started playing [Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands](https://achaea.com) when I was 16 years old, 13 years later, I have come back to it time and time again. Sometimes a game will come along that steals me away for a bit, Diablo II, Diablo III, Final Fantasies, Metal Gear, Halo, Destiny, et cetera. But no matter how the world of gaming progresses, there is simply nothing better to me than what Achaea offers.

If any of you are interested in MUD games, and role playing games, you will never taste anything better than you could get with Achaea.

It has the deepest political structure, the most intricate and fun combat, wars, active divine, everything. And one of the best things, Achaea has been FREE to play since it was created. 

This game evolves all the time, new areas are added, abilities and skills created, many classes to choose from, knights, magic, serpents, shaman, druids, monks, the list goes on.

There are cities to become a part of, houses to join. You can sail the seas, you can become a merchant, or a prolific fighter, ANYTHING.

I implore any of you that want to try something a little different to give Achaea a try today. It starts a little slow in the introduction (maybe 20 minutes before you are set free into the world, to be fair there is a lot to learn, and it's challenging!) (also don't be put off by that cheesy video they have on the site, ha!)

There is so much passion and love poured into this game, and it scares me sometimes to think that the world is moving on to the best graphics and all that other stuff, when this game provides more depth than any next gen console game ever could. Achaea has has a steady set of active players since it was created, maybe around 2000, there are always people online.

I should mention too, that any of you that enjoy coding would get an additional level of satisfaction out of the game, as you can create all sorts of triggers to react to the world. Some denizen drops some gold on the ground? You can make your character pick it up automatically. That is a very small example, it gets so much more in depth than that. You may play through the website, and the client has improved immensely throughout the years, but you can also download a program called  [Mudlet](http://www.mudlet.org/) that will allows you to have a bit more control over what's going on. I should mention too, that the client offers a map that helps a lot (you can download a map for mudlet too!)

For the start though, I recommend just jumping on and playing, it's so much fun! Once you have the hang of things you can look into systems like [svof](https://github.com/svof/svof/releases), a curing system that aids you in intense combat, or just hunting in the wilderness, or slaughtering towns.

**What's everyone's opinion on this game so far?**

My friend and I are absolutely loving this game so far, we're a little sad to see the critic ratings so low (relative to other Zelda and Nintendo games).

The emotes are fun to spam (pom poms!) and trying to communicate with random players is entertaining with the emotes. Reminds me of playing Journey online.

Doing the dungeons/challenges co-op is great fun over Skype with a friend.

The dungeons themselves aren't as large as other 2D zeldas but working together with other players to figure out puzzles is amazing especially in the later dungeons/challenges.

Even my sister who dislikes Zelda's in general enjoys playing this game. 
_________
**Down sides to the game**

The single player is horrible, please do not buy this game for single player. It slows down the game way too much and makes a lot of the puzzles an incredible chore to do since you have to move 3 links.

Story is also pretty terrible.


**My conclusion:**

Buy this game to play online co-op with strangers/friends. Playing Zelda co-op while pom pom emoting your allies is an amazing experience.

Games,"So as per the front page of /r/games today, we saw Aaron Greenberg respond to the possibility of halo going on PC which was that it was exclusive to xbox one and will remain so. That does not bother me, what bothers me is the statement in the response the person asking the question made which was the following:

*""I am relieved and, I hope that some title like halo, gears and quantum break will remain exclusive to the xbox brand""*


I want to discuss how this promotes the trend that current consumer beliefs are what is holding video games back today. Commonly most people share several beliefs when it comes to today's games. Pre-order dlc, dlc exclusivity, etc, we all believe this issues are somethings that need to be fixed urgently as they promote poor business ethics.

The response here how ever seems to promote people should push companies more and more to make platform exclusives and not branch out, when you don't branch out, you can't evolve as a company, you are simply locking yourself into a contract with one brand which really strains you on what you can produce as a company.

The reason we see people urging developers to push to more open platforms is that it enables more community input and use of feedback than it does by limiting it to one console. While  granted growing up, we had consoles exclusives such as ratchet and clank, sly cooper, gears, etc, which were fine at the time because the technology wasn't as evolved as it is now. People seem to forget that games like halo were on the pc and were insanely well received, but due to community based circumstances, microsoft stopped putting some major first party titles on their own operating systems and instead opted to restrict them to their own gaming console.

The ironic twist here is that Windows 10 allows us to do this now, Fable legends is a fine example with it allowing [cross platform play between the xbox one and pc](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/21/7867539/fable-legends-coming-to-pc-features-cross-platform-play-with-xbox-one) yet seemingly when it comes to a big title like halo, which has so much potential, the xbox community seemingly gutters anyone who attempts to try and help the game expand, which in turn then promotes developers to not attempt at expanding. Even though 343's franchise development director Frank O'connor let it slip that [it was quite possible given how windows 10 and Xbox one share very similar elements.](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/developer-theres-plenty-of-chance-of-a-halo-5-pc-port/)

I think it shows how the community today reacts to any attempt at expanding a franchise outside of being a specific console exclusive,  it shows that people would rather prefer companies stick to the same system over and over again then let them expand and try new things. People seemingly don't accept change.

Games,"On its release, Battlefield 4 servers had an alarmingly low tickrate of 10hz.  This was met with considerable backlash from the community, as the lag was very noticeable—with some players deeming it practically unplayable.  While the game was praised for its visual fidelity and gameplay, the multiplayer experience was tarnished by poor server performance.  In the past year, the community test environment has been testing servers with Tickrates of up to 120hz.  For the sake of this discussion, I’ll outline the server update process and then explain why high Tick/Update rates are important.  

The entire server update process is best explained in 2 stages.  Stage 1 is the processing stage, and stage 2 is the update stage.   
 

**Stage 1: Data processing stage**

Naturally, a higher Tickrate requires a server with more processing power.  A higher Update Rate increases the amount of data that is sent between the client and server, meaning that more bandwidth is used.  The main reason why developers choose lower Tickrates/Update Rates is because it’s cheaper overall.   When you factor in thousands of game servers running nonstop for years at a time, the cost of better server performance adds up drastically.  However, shouldn’t devs at least allow the player to rent servers with higher tickrates and update rates?The entire server update process is best explained in 2 stages.  Stage 1 is the processing stage, and stage 2 is the update stage.   
 

**Stage 2: Update stage**

The update rate is defined as how often the client and server exchange data.  Update rates can vary between client and server.  When Battlefield 4 was first released, the client had an update rate of 30hz and the server had an update rate of 10hz.  If a client is receiving updates from a 10hz server, that means that 1 update is being sent to that client every 100 milliseconds.  20hz = 20 updates per second, so 1 update every 50ms.   This system isn’t perfect, but it’s the best we’ve got barring quantum milestones.  

Since there’s a gap between each update, the client needs to simulate the information in-between for the game to appear smooth.  Things like positioning, velocity, and object states are “guessed” by the client, and their values are updated with each packet of information sent by the server.  

This is why a connection loss during a match will often result in other characters running into walls or endlessly firing, as the most recent “state” for those actors was moving in a particular direction or firing.  Since your client is no longer receiving updates, each state is repeated until you’re kicked due to timing out.  

A high Update Rate is important because it means that there’s less “guessing” going on in-between each update that you receive from the server.  Less of a gap between updates corresponds to a more accurate representation of what’s actually going on, much in the same way that [higher fps yields a smoother visual experience](https://boallen.com/fps-compare.html).  


**How FPS factors in**

When Tickrate/Update Rate are lower than your frames per second, you receive less updates than the information is visually displayed on your screen.  This means that the information you see may not accurately match the actual information on the server.  This is partly why lower Tickrates and Update Rates can make gameplay feel choppy or inconsistent, and higher values feel more responsive.  

Low tickrate is often problematic, and this goes double for faster titles.  

If the server isn’t updating quickly enough, player positions may not be accurately represented on your client.  This means that your client and the server may be operating with different information.  For example: Enemy A is moving quickly across your screen.  You quickly snap over and start tracking/firing.  On the server, the enemy is actually just slightly off of the position that you see on your client, which results in your shots not registering.  The faster the game, the more problematic this is.  Here’s a [video example]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkWZtrZx_hM) of the issue (from Titanfall).  This video was recorded when Titanfall servers were operating at 20hz.  


**Summation**

Naturally, a higher Tickrate requires a server with more processing power.  A higher Update Rate increases the amount of data that is sent between the client and server, meaning that more bandwidth is used.  The main reason why developers choose lower Tickrates/Update Rates is because it’s cheaper overall.   When you factor in thousands of game servers running nonstop for years at a time, the cost of better server performance/more bandwidth adds up drastically.  However, shouldn’t devs at least allow the player to rent servers with higher tickrates and update rates?


**TL;DR:** With 1080p/60fps being the standard, shouldn’t a similar standard be set for server performance in multiplayer titles?","With 1080p/60fps being the modern gaming standard, shouldn’t a similar standard be set for server performance in multiplayer titles?"

It's also releasing on the same day as Fallout 4, a game with inescapable hype.

Games,"Hello reddit!

I was chatting with a friend today and something came up: why are Bethesda games so beloved?
First of all, don't get me wrong, this is not a flame war nor it is something to nag about the upcoming Fallout 4. However, I have purchased every Bethesda open-world game since Oblivion, because I was so very hyped. And then I could not finish them, not even one, albeit having dozens of hours in Oblivion.
As a future game designer, I like to know what makes people tick, and while I might see the appeal in massive-open-world, there are some things that bother me.

To start with, even in Skyrim, the animations aren't good. Compared to other games, like Mass Effect 2 or even Witcher 2, they don't sell me on the fantasy, I can't really hop into the world and really ""feel"" what those people are telling me.

Then, compared to other open worlds, I don't see the ""value"" of walking from quest point to quest point. Whereas in other games like MGSV or GTA or even Mad Max we can travel by car/horse and just have fun with it, I have found out that walking in TES/Fallout does not appeal me after the first 5 hours. Discovering the world is nice, but what comes after that?

I know this one is going to be even more controversial, but I love games with good Lore. And although I have followed mainly the main quests in these games, I have found out that some of the stories are rather bland and generic (especially Skyrim), putting aside Fallout 3.

Now, I know that some people put hundreds of hours into these games. And I really want to know why. What does this game offer that they love so much?

Thank you for your time, And again, for me this topic is purely educational and I'm not attacking either Bethesda or their intelectual property, on the contrary.

PS: At the same time I will install Fallout New Vegas so that I can have more ""fresh input"" to infuse in this topic if needed.

&gt;In brief, I'm tired of swinging swords at knees. A sizable number of action games have the player advancing to a taller figure/demon/God and hacking away at their shins until their health is depleted. 

&gt;This is far from new. We hack away at dragon legs in Dragon Age: Inquisition just as much as we hack away at Ganon legs in OoT (though that game did have every boss stoop in some way to let you hack at a weak point at chest level). 

&gt;Hacking at legs is so pervasive that when we get to attack another part of an enemy (Shadow of the Colossus springs to mind, as does better parts of Bayonetta) they become instantly memorable. Going back to Zelda for a moment, even jumping to drive the Master Sword into the forehead of Ganon becomes memorable.

Games,"Can we get a Duke Nukem discussion thread going?

I grew up on this fantastic game and it's a shame to see it dying off. It was amongst the first games I had on my Windows 98 computer growing up. Along with Doom and Wolfenstein, I always favored Duke more than the others. As a relatively young aspiring programmer, I still look up to Ken Silverman, programmer of the BUILD Engine used in Duke Nukem 3D and a few other games in it's day. Fast forward some years later, I was psyched when I heard Duke Nukem Forever was coming out. I personally loved it, but the general opinion of the game was very negative. As DNF flopped terribly it seemed the king has stepped down from his throne. I heard little things here and there about legal spats and concept ideas, but no hard proof of another game. 

Do you think Duke will live on to see a Duke Nukem 5 that hopefully won't flop?

Games,"I want to make this as short as I can, but I can’t make any promises.

I’ve been coming to r/games for years now. It’s no secret that it’s changed a lot since it’s early days, and with it’s huge increase in subscribers have become more rules. That’s understandable, and I don’t begrudge moderators for enforcing the rules.

The problem I have, and many other subscribers have from what I can tell, is that a great many thoughtful or interesting threads that generate a lot of discussion are being deleted on a daily basis. Just for example, an interesting thread entitled “What are your favorite fantasy video game universes?” (https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3sxz6m/what_are_your_favorite_fantasy_video_game/) got deleted today, after being 86% upvoted and commented on over 350 times. And the comments were good. They were constructive, they were friendly, and they were positive.

The big problem I have with this is that a lot of threads like that are deleted on a daily basis. They contain some of the most passionate, enthusiastic discussion I ever see on r/games, and they are routinely deleted despite the fact that the majority of people here seem to enjoy them. What makes it worse is that while these threads about the things we love about games and contain a lot of passion and love for the hobby are deleted constantly, threads that exist almost solely to outrage and incite vitriol persist. Where are the priorities on this subreddit that claims to be for “Quality Gaming Discussion”? R/games has become known more and more around reddit for its tendency to react negatively to many things, and it’s true that it has become decidedly more negative and quick to anger (rightly or wrongly) and deleting threads that could counteract that culture and bring in more people who are enthusiastic and positive about games isn’t helping.

So I guess that’s my question: Why do these threads celebrating gaming and what we love about it get relegated to the trash while so many links proclaiming doom and gloom and impropriety on behalf of publishers or developers remain?

I’m not saying that attention shouldn’t be brought to cases of dodgy practices but it’s *completely* lop-sided when you’re removing content that would do wonders to balance out a lot of the negativity and outrage seen in this Subreddit on a regular basis. It’s really just a matter of balance, and that seems sorely lacking to me, and could be remedied with a simple relaxing of rule 7.

Another example would be that yesterday, three of the top four threads were reports on how many copies games sold. I really can’t understand how those threads could in any way be considered more “Quality Gaming Discussion” than the other threads like the one I mentioned. There was little discussion in those threads and mostly statements or comments. Perhaps the problem is that this subreddit is more concerned with the hard facts in gaming and not the experience or enjoyment of the games themselves. It’s just my opinion, but I’d like to see that change.

“Those are the rules” doesn’t really hold water when you think about all of that, in my opinion and this is brought up often, by many subscribers. Maybe it’s time to re-write some rules and loosen up a little? More discussion about the games themselves and what we love about them can’t possibly hurt this subreddit, and only improve it.

*Just as a disclaimer: I have never made one of these threads I’m referring to nor had one deleted, so this isn’t a reaction to feeling wronged personally. I’d just like to see more discussion about games to balance out the industry discussion this subreddit tends toward.*",[META] An open letter to the /r/games moderators: Rule 7 needs re-thinking.

Games,"Thanksgiving dinner discussion yesterday revolved around all-chat in multiplayer video games, and the direction the market (largely through Blizzard) seems to be taking with regards to it.

Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are both recent games that do not allow players to directly speak to whomever they are playing against. SMITE is an example of a game that bans it during gameplay, but allows for post-game discussion in a shared lobby. Recently, Valve took out the ability to voice-chat the other team at any point in a competitive game of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

**Overall, it seems that the big competitive multiplayer games being released are not allowing players to communicate with the other team during the game (if at all).** I can only imagine the point of this is to avoid the ""toxicity"" issue that seems to be talked about quite a bit in multiplayer games. We didn't reach a consensus during dinner yesterday; half of us said that all-chat should remain in multiplayer games (with an ability to mute players/disable team chat), while the other half appreciated Blizzard's efforts and wants to see every multiplayer game block communication with the other team/player during gameplay.

The two big juggernauts right now in MOBAs (League of Legends and Dota 2) do allow players to talk to the other team if they wish, but these games were released years ago, so I'm more talking about the future of multiplayer games as opposed to how things are right now.

Games,"Long story short, my copy of Fallout 4 on PS4 is likely getting traded-in soon. My decision to trade in the game is affected by many different issues with the game's performance being one of the main reasons, specifically the framerate inconsistencies.  
  
I was willing to look past a lot of the game's minor flaws. Even as many people were saying the graphics looked like ass, I actually think the game looks pretty good graphically. I was most excited about the gunplay which, from what I saw from early gameplay videos, looked to be much improved from past Fallout titles in terms of aiming, controller responsiveness, magnetism, etc. Don't get me wrong, the gunplay IS a huge improvement in Fallout 4... That is when my framerate isn't wildly fluctuating and dipping into the ""teens"". Certain enemies like molerats, mirelurks, and especially ghouls are way bigger pains in the ass then they should be because it feels like they just ""teleport "" around from my perspective. Ghouls will be a good distance away then perform their jump attack and in just one frame will be right in my face with no way to predict their movements. Because of all this, combat just doesn't seem to flow naturally.  
  
So, on to my actual question. Is it realistic to expect Fallout 4's performance on consoles to improve through developer patches? I saw lots of talk relating to the framerate issues of Fallout 4 here on reddit, with many users saying things like ""the patches will fix this"". In my experience with other games though, this doesn't seem to be the case. A prime example for me would be Skyrim on the PS3. I'm sure many of you on this sub know of the issues that affected PS3 players and how, after seemingly years of patches, the game is still a mess and was never, in my opinion, noticeably improved.

Bethesda already has a history of using the engine for their Elder Scrolls games to create Fallout games so would they possibly take the engine they created for ESO and simply make a Fallout MMO?

The amount of marketing and advertising they did for Fallout 4 was much greater than what they did for Skyrim so they clearly feel the IP of Fallout is valuable and has appeal.  Also Bethesda payed Interplay 2 million dollars in 2012 in the settlement of the lawsuit between the two companies in order to gain control of the rights to an actual Fallout MMO.

Of course one thing that makes me think they may not be planning something like this is Zenimax Online Studios did a round of layoffs in late 2014 and those consisted mainly of customer service and development staff.  If they were in fact working on creating a Fallout MMO using the ESO engine I would not expect to see layoffs in development.

**Can the Wii U handle those games?**

The GPU inside the Wii U is comparable to a Radeon HD 4770. That is basically the recommended GPU for a Civilization 5 and Total War: Shogun 2 and it is just powerful enough to run Endless Legend. So it can be done. 

**4x games don't sell that well compared to other genres. So why bother porting it over?**

NEWS FLASH, the quality of a game doesn't drive sales. Bayonetta 2's sales provide evidence to that statement. A game's marketability and it's accessibility drives sales. 4x games do fine on PC with virtually no marketing at all. And there isn't enough evidence to say that 4x games don't do well on consoles because there aren't any 4x games on consoles! Nintendo should be like, *""Hey guys! Look at all of these wonderful PC games that weren't playable on consoles before but are now playable on our console!""* If they did that, I'm sure it would do fine because its a selling point for the Wii U gamepad. 

If Sega and Firaxis ported their old games right now to the Wii U, I swear they would find an untapped market and a new audience for their games. It worked for iPads. It can work for the Wii U too. They could even throw in some Nintendo characters for fan service to help it's marketability. They did it for Hyrule Warriors and its a success!

The console and it's gamepad is literally built for this genre. Why doesn't Nintendo do it? I'm am extremely baffled by it. 

**EDIT:** I'm seeing a lot of closed minded arguments about how 4x games only have a market on a PC platform and can't find a market on consoles. You all need a history lesson. Remember what genres dominated the PC platform back in the 90's? It was FPS and Action Adventure RPGs (Unreal Tournament, Doom, Morrowwind, ect). ""Nothing can ever replace the precision of a Keyboard and Mouse."" Bullshit. Now, those same genres dominate the consoles (CoD, Fallout, Skyrim, Halo, Destiny, ect). ","4x games would be a convenient, appropriate, and awesome ganre for the Wii U. So why doesn't Nintendo try to make it happen?"

Games,"Listing the minimum requirements for a game is not a definitive way of giving the customer information about how the game is going to perform. 

We already have the means to refund games if technical problems are faced, but it could be avoided if companies were to provide something that can give you a better idea about how the game is going to perform. 

I've had to refund certain titles through Steam because of extremely poor performance *despite* exceeding the requirements by far. While this system does work on a certain level, I'd rather not make the purchase and download tens of gigabytes worth of stuff only to be able to find out that I can't run the game properly.

I love the XCOM reboot, and I while I know I played one of the older ones, I don't remember the game any more than that. 

Before the XCOM reboot I played the shit out of the UFO: Aftermath/shock/light games, I must've replayed them all at least 2-3 times each. 

Now, what I wanted to talk about was the tech progression in XCOM. If there's one thing I'm not 100% in love with in XCOM:EU/EW is that I feel the tech progression is too fast. 

What I absolutely loved in the first UFO: Aftermath was the fact that the [very first mission](http://i.imgur.com/16toTQu.jpg) started out with your average Joe grabbing his old shotgun and went out in the streets to blast some aliens. He finds another guy with a MAC-10 (or similar) and they go about their shooty business. 
That's exactly what I loved about the game - you have a ragtag team with regular guns going against the superior alien armory using tactics and cunning. 

I recognize that EW starts something like this as well, but after just a couple of missions/research done you start replacing your guns with [laser rifles and plasma](http://i.imgur.com/NrSPE1V.jpg) etc. Even the starting guns don't resemble guns we already have, they already look a bit too futuristic for my tastes.

I just think it moves way too fast - me personally I would prefer to have more regular guns and upgrade them with mods etc, rather than going for the laser right away. It kind of removes the feeling of encountering a ""superior"" race; you're adapting way too quickly and become on par with their technology I feel.

Anyway it's more a feeling based on facts, but it's something that's always bugged me a bit. Also I haven't played Long War but I think that mod adresses this a bit?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

Games,"A truly forgotten game, LCS has been around for a very long time, inspired by a DOS game from the 80s, Tarn Adams made this game around 2003-2004. 

Liberal Crime Squad is a unique game where you manage a group of liberal activists (The Liberal Crime Squad) in varying political states of the country. The goal of the game is to shift public opinion and legislation in the country from conservative to liberal. Depending on how you set up the game, this can vary wildly.

For example, in an easy game, your crime squad will consist of a variety of activities falling under several categories including liberal activism (community service, graffiti, writing to newspapers), legal fundraising (bake sales, fundraisers), illegal fundraising (drugs and prostitution. You're to do all this while avoiding being raided by either the police or the Conservative Crime Squad. 

Of course, if the situation of the country is conservative enough the game will vary in difficulty. In an arch-conservative society, free speech is limited and thus speaking against the government warrants a military raid against you, and you  are forced into more violent action such as liberating child slaves from factories or preventing public executions. Such arch-conservative laws also make the game more difficult, such as summary execution of minorities (making it harder to operate peacefully in the open) and capital offenses for minor crimes like swearing.

There is a political system and a public opinion system. Ultimately, your goal is both shift public opinion to liberalism, while also influencing the government to enact liberal legislation and elect liberal congressmen. 

Much like Dwarf Fortress, the game features very spartan graphics. ASCII, with a bare UI. However despite the spartan graphics, much like dwarf fortress, the game is very deep and rewarding and provides much emergent gameplay and very unique stories and gameplay opportunities. 

What really prompted me to post about this game is that I see so much around here about Dwarf Fortress, yet the developer has another, forgotten game that has many of the qualities that DF has, and is, well, a good, funny, game about political activism.

Games,"so this might sound a post youll want to down vote after you read it especially if youre a fan of the game, but remember i just want to honestly ask a question/for some opinions, 


ill be as short as i can,


&amp;nbsp;

i heard all the hype and prazie about the combat of this game, but after 5 or 6 hours the combat really just feels like a dumbed down version of Dragon Age Inquisition, i had problem with how dumbed down DAI was from DAO as you dont really control that much of party members (if you want to play fluently) but you can at least issue commands to hold certain position or manually cast some crucial spell/automatically fire certain spells,,

&amp;nbsp;

Now in Dragons Dogma, everything is even dumber and less strategical(thus less fun), ill write an example, 


theres a relatively difficult road at the start of the game to go to Witch Woods to rescue a girl as one of the early quest in the game, , my 4 member party ventured in and died several times as the enemies are just far more powerful both individually and in great numbers, but however **i managed to kill all of them through a great pain of hit and run and endlessly revive party members(0 hp to half health instantly, which is dumb and op), I cant help but start to imagine how things would be so much easier if this was in DAI or DAO, as i would just issue commands and make my 3 other member hold a position while i mess around in between the enemy bandits** with dodge and blocking and let my party members shoot them to death while i stun lock the hardest one with a sword move i have,  instead, my party member just run blindly around (especially that guy with a bow just suddenly decided to melee instead of range on the hoard of  higher level enemies), also would i be able to customize their spell usage, i would put the sword enhance spell to much better use as 70% of the time my sword arent enhanced when i really needed it.  


I spammed the Come to Me command so hard while hit and run but in the end my pawns are nothing but a meat shield for me as i endlessly revive them 0 to 50%(theyll die almost insntantly again and again) while i chipped away little by little the enemy crowds using position and some nice dash and stun lock sword moves.

&amp;nbsp;

**So**, should i expect better from this game later on or this is generally what the combat of this game is,  with some hold position and accurate magic spell i can really take on far more harder enemies with strategy rather than the now almost AI vs AI feel hack and slash(the party with higher average stats wins).

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: cant understand the hype of the combat of this game as it feels literally a dumbed down/worse version of DAI and is not really fun because the lack of strategy and the generally bland way of fighting.(and DAI's combat was considered mediocre especially compared to DAO, also, i know climbing is cool, but thats just boss fight and really nothing special once you get used to the idea, plus most of the time youre not fighting bosses anyway)

",My problem with Dragon's Dogma's Combat so far
Games,"I knew it was going to happen, eventually. I knew that at around the 20 hours into Fallout 4 I'd just get tired. I would put down the controller, put down the game, and likely not revisit it for several months.

I get this way with lots of open world games. I love them for the first 20 hours, but at some point, it all gets overwhelming, and I stop caring. 

I recently saw a TED Talk about the Paradox of Choice, where having too many choices is not necessarily a good thing, that we get overwhelmed by the choices, and that because we pick ""one"" out of several choices, we tend to wonder if another choice was better.

I think this is why RPGs that give you several missions at once, and several ways to go about it are actually doing the gamer a diservice than a more linear game, or games that limit your options between a few choices.

Look at THPS5. 7gb Day-One Patch which is essentially the whole game. Without it you can only play the tutorial. Or look at Just Cause 3 PS4. There is a gamebreaking bug in the second mission which was fixed with the Day-One Patch. 

More and more games get big patches at release with lots of optimisation and bug fixing. Last gen with the PS3, most patches where around 100mb and I played most games without them. But you can't just play games without 7gb of bugfixing anymore. 

So what do you think. Will Gamecollecting die with this generation? Is it worth it collecting games that aren't fully functional anymore when publishers decide to turn of the servers? To be a bit more cynical will we see more and more rereleases of games because of that? Maybe in two generations we will see a HD-Re-Remake of games just so that they are playable?

Games,"So I've been on a bit of a Shadow of the Colossus craze lately, anyone who regularly talks to me knows, I go *crazy* at the slight mention of the game.  Despite my PC gaming tendencies I suffered through the low framerates (which even persist on the ps3 version apparently, all I have is a PS2, so I played it on that) and finally beat the game recently, and as I was listening to the soundtrack it hit me what is so absolutely brilliant about the music choice in the game, something that I've never seen done in a video game before.

[The game begins with] (https://youtu.be/GRnIRjV1-Ow?t=23) a slow, somber journey into the ""ancient land"" (the song is even called ""to the ancient land"").  This song does a good job of introducing the tone for the emotions you experience during this game.  This is Wander's last hope. This is just one of the most important scores in the game, one which you even hear at the end of the game as a kind of callback, remixed to be a bit creepier and slower (as the end of the game is more eerie and depressing).

As the game begins, before each colossus, you are given a small ye olde english explenation of each of the colossi and sometimes a small cryptic hint of how to beat it by the deity.  Then you are greeted by complete lonely silence.  Only you and your horse remain, and as you ride through the intentionally baren landscape, you get a sense of lonelyness as you inch your way to your next goal.  This is an important ""calm before the storm"" if you will.  A nervous reminder of what is to come.

Next, as you become closer to the colossi, a quiet instrumental plays, in some of them you can hear the colossus's slow steps.  Not all of the colossi have this part, but the ones that do help build up an important tension.  It is important that the player cannot see the colossus while this segment of music is being played, but you can almost hear the colossus, and get an idea of it.  [The first one shows this well] (https://youtu.be/EOJwDeAV_mc?t=898).

Now you've finally reached the collosus, [an opening cutscene plays] (https://youtu.be/KFPNEWjCp70?t=304) showing the sheer size of the monster you're about to conquer, and the next bit of music begins to play, this one is always a whimsical tune, perfectly fit for the situation you're in, that is, you're running around (or on a horse in some cases) trying to figure out how the hell you're going to get on the thing.  The important word there is ""whimsical"",  the music now portrays a sense of danger, and also confusion, but it is not as exciting as it could be yet...

Next is the best part, you've finally made it on top of the colossus, and you are desperately climbing to find the creature's weak spot.  Desperate is also a good word to describe the music, because it is exciting, but also still depicts a dangerous tone, all I can say is, [listen] (https://youtu.be/KFPNEWjCp70?t=391)

Finally, as the colossi falls and you have completed your goal, [a sad chorus plays] (https://youtu.be/KFPNEWjCp70?t=515), and although you've completed your goal, you can't help but feel guilt as this almost innocent creature falls to its death because of you.

Go ahead and watch all of the links I've implemented in, they show what I mean better than I can explain, watch about a minute of each, then come back and read the next paragraph.  Each of these orchestrated tracks that play are all masterpieces in my honest opinion, some of the best music I've ever seen in a video game, used perfectly for each situation.

I'm no writer, but I just needed to get this out there because I think that SotC is an important game to this industry, and though it is seen as a classic, I still think it deserves more attention.

 - My PC has a 21:9 monitor, I understand I can change the resolution in game to 1080p to match the tv but is this going to cause me problems?
 - How often do you encounter problems?  Game crashes?  Steam crashes?  Any sort of game disrupting issues or bugs?
 - How would you describe your overall experience with the Steam Link?  Do you still use it often?  Was it worth the purchase?

Thanks for anyone who takes the time to join the discussion.

Things I'm taking away from this:

 - Have a solid network setup if you plan to use a Steam Link.
 - Wifi is very hit and miss and more often than not seems to result in a sub-par experience.
 - A powerline adapter can be the difference between a good and bad experience if you do plan to go wire-free.
 - If you can get it working at a standard that's suitable to you it seems to be worth the investment.

Games,"The 360/PS3 versions of Resident Evil 6 ran at a very unstable 30fps, dropping to 20fps in places. The 2013 PC version, assuming your hardware is capable, runs a 60-120fps. The new PS4/XBO versions run at 60fps. (They also have the FOV maxxed out and QTE assist/improved vehicle controls enabled by default, but that's a side issue.)

The reception in general is much better. I've seen people who disliked the game before now describing it as ""like playing a completely different game"". There's less complaining about aiming, about unresponsive controls, and stuff like that.

If you've played both the old and the new versions, what do you think? Was the poor framerate a serious problem in retrospect?",I think RE6's mixed reception in 2012 was created partially by the game's atrocious frame rate paired with no aim assist and gameplay often requiring split second timing.
Games,"There’s already a post on this subreddit related to this, but it’s almost a year old now and has been archived, so I thought I’d bring up the subject once more.

I’ve recently been thinking about the term ""Walking Simulator"" and how many people see it as a very negative thing. I tried to look up the exact definition and as far as I could find out, there isn’t one. The consensus on what the term indicates is “a game that consists mostly of walking around”, which makes sense. What it has seemingly come to mean, however, is some sort of virtual environment (many hesitate to call them games), that is woefully lacking in mechanics and is, therefore, less interesting or valid than other games. It has received a negative connotation. However, I have played many (what I would consider) games, such as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner’s Guide and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or more obvious examples like Proteus, that I found very enjoyable. I’d submit that in some of these cases, the term itself is a misnomer. The object of those games is not to simulate walking but to explore, follow the story or make choices, even. Therefore, I thought maybe we should talk about the idea of Walking Simulators being intrinsically worse than games that rely on mechanics.

The thing about the term “Walking Simulator” is that it implies the title is not a “real” game. Your definition of what “real” means in this context may vary. From my point of view, the only requirement is that it must have rules, which are not the same thing as mechanics, mind you. Think of the original board games, such as Chess. They have rules to pose obstacles and determine win-conditions. That, to me, is the minimum requirement for a game to be able to call itself a game. Walking Simulators are called what they’re called because they often don’t involve a lot of mechanics. You usually follow a narrative path, either linear or branched, but there isn’t any noteworthy gameplay involved aside from pressing w, a, s, d and spacebar. Still, in the strictest sense, those experiences have rules. The existence of the game world alone, which is a very clear confinement, would qualify as a rule in this train of thought. Moreover, you are continually choosing to take part in what the game is offering you by playing it. Since it relies on you to keep interacting with it, there is a win condition, such as: ”press w long enough and eventually, you will get to the end”. I refrain from calling this a mechanic because then I’d have to criticise the game for having lacklustre mechanics when in fact the absence of them is the unique thing about this genre.

If you wanted to simplify it to a single statement, you could say this: All games require a degree of interactivity and a set of rules.

Now whether those types of games tend to have a higher, equal or lesser value is not really the point of the discussion. Plus, that would probably depend on the individual comparison you’re trying to draw as well as personal preference. I’m simply voicing some thoughts I’ve been meaning to write down for some time. I imagine most people would argue that the whole point of a game, i.e. an interactive experience, is to give the player something to do and, in most cases, something to fail at. However, whether that is intrinsically more valuable than seeing a really well fleshed-out story from the unique perspectives that games can offer, I don’t think it’s possible to reach an objective conclusion on that.

Now I’m not saying that people who dislike Walking Simulators are wrong in saying that they can have a tendency to be less engaging. I’m merely trying to point out my personal opinion on them, which is that perhaps we should not be so quick to dismiss these games as “lesser than” and look at them individually. I’d like to get an interesting conversation started, so what’s your take on this? Do you think it’s a worthwhile discussion to have considering the relatively low amount of games in this genre compared to the rest of them? Do you like playing them or do you typically stay away from them? Do you disagree with my logic in this post? I’d love to hear some thoughts!",I wrote this short little essay on Walking Simulators and would like some input

3. The game penalizes players for going solo as Xv1 situations don't allow for good skilled players to out play multiple enemies. 

4. Matches seem to be more about reverent control. 

And while you can say it feels like a game that caters to new comers, new players are better off playing other games that handle the features that DOOM borrows from. 

Honestly the newest version of Unreal Tournament is a far better example of classic PC death match FPS but even that game doesn't have as big of an audience as it should. 

So where does DOOM fit in today's library? Do you feel that snapmap might be what keeps the multiplayer aspect fresh? Will it be worth it just as a single player game?



",Is DOOM going to be an fps that's quickly forgotten?
Games,"So I just got done replaying Wolfenstein: The New Order. Perhaps one of my favorite things about the game was how it had such a high-quality narrative.

That got me thinking about Doom. I've seen, and am super stoked for the gameplay. But I'm also hoping that the revival will have a good story line to go with it. I know Wolfenstein and Doom were made by two separate developers, but with them both being id classics, and being published by bethesda, I have high hopes for a similar high-quality treatment.

So anyway, what do you guys think the plot will be, and what might the quality of said plot be?",Is it safe to assume Doom will have a high quality narrative like Wolfenstein did? What are you expecting the story to be like?

""Hi,

I'd like to start by personally saying thank you for being such a long time supporter of the games I’ve been working on.

As you may know, people often say ""the third time is the charm”. While the first two were actually pretty good, and WarZ/ISS and Aftermath are doing well, I still have a sour taste for some of the things that I’ve been unable to achieve in those games.

With that said I am proud to present to you Shattered Skies - an open world Looter Shooter sandbox survival game with NO monetization/microtransactions. 

26 minutes of gameplay video - https://youtu.be/3LHWaeuRpX8
PLAY AT www.playshatteredskies.com 


Shattered Skies takes place in a ruined world devastated by a comet impact that struck the moon and rained thousands of meteorites down to earth introducing vicious predatory aliens to the planet. Shattered Skies is packed with beautiful scenic vistas and tons of lootable items in a full loot drop no holds barred PVP world. I'm sure you'll have a great time!

Please check our official website for detailed information and uncut gameplay footage of Shattered Skies. Alpha will be open to the public on April 15th, and until then we’re offering great discounts for anyone who pre-purchases Shattered Skies. On top of the pre-order discount I’m offering you an additional personal discount as a thank you for your support over the years – just enter AVIDGAMER as your promo code at the checkout page before April 10th to get even more savings!

Anticheat is a #1 priority to us as some of you may know we’ve been able to defeat the cheating problem in recent Aftermath builds, and we’re going even further with an even more advanced Anticheat in Shattered Skies.

We also pledge that we won’t have microtransactions in the game. A one time purchase provides you with full access to all the game features, in game items, weapons and character cosmetics / weapon customization's. There is no way to spend real cash money in game to gain any sort of advancement or advantage over another player, there is NO store. You must earn your gear, cosmetics and bragging rights by simply playing the game :)

Shattered Skies is designed to provide plenty of early and end game opportunities for players of all types. With great loot and extensive skills/leveling up opportunities as well as late game features like epic summoned world boss fights, exploration quests, and dynamic battles created between groups of players and clans by fortifying buildings.

All of this is set in super detailed gorgeous environment that is running butter smooth on relatively affordable PC hardware ( our ultra settings demo is running 60-90fps on nvidia 970 video card at 1080p resolution ). Check it outhttps://youtu.be/3LHWaeuRpX8


Once again thank you for being loyal customer and I hope to see you in Shattered Skies!

I know The WarZ/ISS/Aftermath have been huge topics of controversy so I thought I'd bring this to light. Once again some shady tactics seem to be in place, if you watch the gameplay footage they boast about the smoothness and frame rates they achieve ingame..however they are playing a build with zero AI threats, and none are even showcased in the 26 mins of gameplay. They are also claiming zero micro-transactions and a great anti-cheat system that they have been testing for months. 

Upon going to the website and checking their media page, all ""ingame"" screenshots once again appear to be just in-engine posed shots that don't reflect real gameplay. Also the alien designs shown in these photos look suspiciously close to the Necromorph designs in Dead Space.

Tl;dr: Sergey appears to be at it again to mislead people out of money.","Sergey Titov (The WarZ) back with a new game, Shattered Skies."

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Mike Guarino - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/severed-review/)

&gt;DrinkBox has succeeded in not only making a fantastic game, but also making the PlayStation Vita relevant again in a time where most have left it for dead. Severed is the call to all gamers to dig out their dusty Vitas once more, as the neglected handheld has quietly acquired one of the must-have games of 2016.

--------------

**CGMagazine** - Lisa Mior - [9.5 / 10.0](http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/severed-ps-vita-drinkbox-review/)

&gt;As challenging as it is rewarding, Severed is a reason to dust of your PS Vita and get slashing.

**COGconnected** - Tyler Treese - [95 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/severed-review/)

&gt;It’s a beautiful game that needs to be seen, and every single aspect has been designed with care.

**Destructoid** - Zack Furniss - [9.5 / 10.0](http://www.destructoid.com/review-severed-357649.phtml)

&gt;When that's the worst I can come up with, it's clear to me that DrinkBox Studios knocked it out of the park. I'm glad the team took its time.

--------------

**Digital Chumps** - Eric Layman - [8.2 / 10.0](http://digitalchumps.com/game-reviews/154-sony-vita/severed.html)

&gt;If a colorful, morbid, corporeal, dungeon-crawling Punch-Out!! isn't sweet enough to sell Severed, consider it a vision of a world where the PlayStation Vita remained a stronghold of original and endearing creation.

--------------

**EGM** - Ray Carsillo - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/severed-review/)

&gt;DrinkBox Studios pushes the boundaries on the Vita’s unique hardware once again. Although from a technical perspective it occasionally lets them down, Severed’s unique combat system and beautiful art style carry the day on what is a fun, if not short-lived, dungeon crawler.

--------------

**Game Rant** - Cody Gravelle - [4 / 5 stars](http://gamerant.com/severed-vita-review/)

&gt;Drinkbox Studios' Severed is a touch-based action RPG with an interesting premise, incredible visuals, and fun gameplay that simply overstays its welcome a little.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Gil Almogi - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/severed)

&gt;Overall, Severed does a lot of good with its excellent and challenging combat, intricate dungeon maps full of collectibles, unique and visceral upgrade system, and a fantastic presentation. Its biggest shortcoming is its lack of opportunities to engage with its world and Sasha’s history, but with everything that works so well about the game, I can mostly forgive this slight. My roughly nine-hour experience was a great joy, filled with memorable sights, sounds, and (physical) touches. Maybe, like Okami for Playstation 2, it will be the console’s swan song, but it is hard to discredit a unique experience like this one purely for coming to the party so late.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Jason D'Aprile - [8 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/severed-review/1900-6416415/)

&gt;Severed's distinct look and touchscreen controls make it more than your average dungeon crawler.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Matt Welsh - [90 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/severed-review/)

&gt;With an emotional story and touch-based combat that feels both clever and natural, Severed is an excellent game that will stick with you long after you’ve finished playing.

--------------

**GBAtemp** - Prans Dunn - [9.5 / 10.0](http://gbatemp.net/review/severed.454/)

&gt;Out now for an ailing console, Severed will be remembered as one of those “console-defining” games. Actually, it’s more than just a game. It is a memorable experience unique to the PSVita that is to be savoured in its entirety.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Dan Murphy - [8 / 10.0](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/severed-ps-vita-review/)

&gt;Severed takes a gimmick in touch-based combat and actually manages to successfully wrap an entertaining game around it. The eerie, ambiguous, yet beautiful, world helps but I found that enough new aspects were added to the combat to keep it interesting until the very end. If this is the Vita’s swansong then it’s going out on a wonderful note.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Matt Whittaker - [4.5 / 5.0](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=203940)

&gt;Despite the fact that the PlayStation Vita’s low install base could potentially hinder Severed‘s success, DrinkBox’s gamble on Sony’s struggling handheld will likely pay off.

--------------

**IGN** - Miranda Sanchez - [6.4 / 10.0](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/26/severed-review)

&gt;Severed is at its best when it features short, tactical fights in its eerily beautiful dungeons, but those battles largely lose their appeal by the second half. Combat becomes tedious due to boring buffs instead of introducing new ideas in order to make battles more challenging. That blow to the combat’s longevity wouldn’t have felt so bad if exploring the bizarre world weren’t so tedious.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - John-Paul Jones - [9.5 / 10.0](http://www.psu.com/review/29873/Severed-PS-Vita-Review)

&gt;A grim and foreboding fairytale liberally swathed in colourful style, Severed masterfully combines touch screen combat, metroidvania game design and hugely satisfying character progression to make the most essential PS Vita title to date. Severed is quite simply a handheld tour de force without equal.

--------------

**Polygon** - Justin McElroy - [9 / 10.0](http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/26/11487856/severed-review-vita)

&gt;Severed's terrific mechanics are as universal as its moving story

--------------

**Push Square** - Sammy Barker - [6 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psvita/severed)

&gt;A valiant attempt at creating a touch screen-based action experience with real depth, Severed struts confidently for four or five hours – before ultimately devolving into the same old swipe-fest that it seems to detest. Still, this is a wonderfully presented experience, with a mystifying world and some intelligent level design. If you're the kind of person who appreciates tailored Vita titles, then you'll more than get your money's worth here. It's just a shame that the studio fails to cut the foray off before it gets stale.

--------------

**TechnoBuffalo** - Joey Davidson - [Buy](http://www.technobuffalo.com/reviews/severed-review-a-dark-and-horrifying-tale-on-the-ps-vita/)

&gt;Severed is one hell of a game, complete with addicting mechanics, a bizarre and wonderful story, moments of pure horror and a silent heroine that does the

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Aran Suddi - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/26/severed-review/)

&gt;Across Severed’s seven or so hours, you get to experience some of the best touch screen gaming around. DrinkBox Studios have created a great game here with an engaging battle system and art style. It can feel a bit too minimalist in its design, and there’s much repetition in the environments, but DrinkBox Studios have created a great game with an engaging battle system and art style. If you own a Vita, Severed is worth getting.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Shaan Joshi - [4 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/severed-review/)

&gt;While a touch-focused first person dungeon crawler might sound crazy on paper, Severed's unique brand of combat is as deep as it is engaging. Oh, and the visuals and soundtrack are bonkers to boot.

",Severed(PS Vita) Review Thread
Games,"Back when PS4 and Xbox One were released, a lot of people were recommending not to buy either one until more games are released for the consoles.

I've been looking to buy one of these consoles for a while now, but I still haven't been able to find a game that is a huge system seller for me. Games that have caught my attention have eventually been ported to PC, so no need to buy a console yet. 

In fact, my friends who owned either an Xbox 360 or PS3 have not yet bought a PS4 or Xbox One. I asked them why they haven't and they said that there aren't any games on them that have caught their interest.

The only exception seems to be Wii U. Nintendo has made some great console exclusives these past few years and I see a lot of people saying that you should just get a Wii U.

What do you think? Has this generation of consoles started extremely slow in terms of console exclusives and system sellers?",Does this generation of consoles lack system sellers so far?
Games,"Fast Travel is a solution, but what problem is it solving? What is it offering or trying to alleviate?

I think the base assumption most gamers and developers both make is that it's there for convenience, that traversing the environment would take too long otherwise.

As open-world games become more and more in-vogue, this explanation has merit. Often the size of the map is among the first talking points in promoting a game, and here on reddit you'll see tons of comparisons noting how it stacks up to other big name open world games.

But ...that's not really the problem Fast Travel is solving.

The core, the heart of the issue, is that traversing the world in most of these games isn't fun. Either moving your character isn't fun, or the dynamic environment isn't fun, or the contextual encounters aren't fun, or just that the trip is far too long for any fun to sustain itself.

Let's look at a game where traversal is fun and engaging: Sunset Overdrive. While contentious in other ways, Sunset Overdrive's traversal kept the player engaged while allowing them to indulge in distractions along the way.

In its composition, movement in Sunset Overdrive had many elements: you could grind, wallrun, bounce, flip, hop, springboard and dash. All of these were used in combat to avoid damage, and you use all of them to get from A to B.

As well, the game grades you on how well you're stringing these things together without touching the ground, and you were rewarded for this as well.

In the end, creating a large open world is usually treated as a checkbox feature that needs to be in the game because it's trendy. The decision to do this isn't married with gameplay, so gameplay tends to stop where traversal begins. The quick solution is fast travel, but the elegant solution is to make traversal as enjoyable as the rest of the game.",Let's talk about fast travel

**Genre:** MMORPG

**Metacritic:** [89](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/guild-wars) User: 8.4

-------------------------------------

**Summary**

&gt;  Guild Wars takes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder. You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.

**UPDATE:**
[Here's a video if you want to test drive it in your Cardboard setup.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6q3w_5MpY0)

And [here's](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xdhnltsqx64jqg3/anaglyph-to-sbs.glsl) the configured shader file I'm using.

Shader parameters are broken in Retroarch on Android, so you have to open the file in a text editor if you want to tweak it. You'll want to make a new folder on your internal memory for shaders, change your shader path to that folder in Retroarch, and then put this GLSL file in that folder. Retroarch is amazing, but incredibly finnicky,  good luck!

The parameters I'm using are probably a little more zoomed-out than an actual Virtual Boy, but anything closer makes it difficult to see in the peripheral.

Set palette to 0.0 for red

**ORIGINAL POST:**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning on writing a detailed guide on how to get this up and running -- but in the meantime:
&gt; 
&gt; Prerequisites:
&gt; 
&gt; * Android Phone
&gt; * Google Cardboard (I'm using a Gear VR) 
&gt; * Retroarch for Android
&gt; 
&gt; There's a Virtual Boy core for Retroarch called ""Mednafen VB,"" by default, it'll render Virtual Boy games in 2D, but it also has the ability to render games as **[3D anaglpyhs](http://i.imgur.com/Heo3ct6.jpg)** (i.e., red/blue glasses). There unfortunately isn't any way to output a 3d image as a side-by-side pair of images that would be easier to digest for a Google Cardboard setup.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Retroarch has support for a neat feature called ""Video Shaders."" Each shader is a script that executes a set of post-processing effects to the video output. One of these shaders, ""anaglyph-to-sbs,"" will split an anaglpyh image into a VR-friendly side-by-side image. 
&gt; 
&gt; After a lot of tweaking, **[this was the result.](http://i.imgur.com/He4thIy.jpg)**
&gt; 
&gt; If you're not a fan of red, you can also adjust the shader to **[output the image in grayscale.](http://i.imgur.com/DYLljs7.jpg)**
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what it looks like through the lens: **[Red](http://i.imgur.com/ZiNaEPJ.jpg), [Grayscale](http://i.imgur.com/Vmpsfpn.jpg)**
&gt; 
&gt; After about 30 minutes of play time, I'm not experiencing any of the Virtual Boy's trademark motion sickness. There's also something to be said for playing the games in grayscale instead of the headache-inducing red. It's pretty cool to see Virtual Boy games in their full stereoscopic glory, but the added depth doesn't seem to add much value gameplay-wise. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the grand scheme of things, this is the cheapest way to play Virtual Boy games in 3D. I'm wondering if there are any other consoles that would benefit from emulation in VR. I'm also curious if the team behind Citra (the 3DS emulator) have any intention of building VR support for 3DS emulation..[.](http://i.imgur.com/I99bESO.jpg)",Emulating Virtual Boy in 3D on Gear VR/Google Cardboard

**Summary**

&gt; The first true sequel to the classic 1988 Nintendo Entertainment System original, Bionic Commando sees the return of the bionically-enhanced Nathan ""Rad"" Spencer, voiced by Mike Patton, the former lead singer of Faith No More. Time has not been kind to Spencer: 10 years after his heroic defeat of the Imperials in the original game, he has been betrayed by the government he swore to serve, imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit, and sentenced to death. On the very day of Spencer's execution, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that has turned the city into rubble and wiped out its population. With the terrain in ruins and the city's air defense grid now in the control of a massive terrorist force whose goal remains unclear, the FSA have only one option left - a behind-the-lines assault. The perfect job for a Bionic Commando. Bionic Commando transposes the swing-and-shoot gameplay of the 8-bit original to a stunning 3D environment of towering buildings, suspended roadways and monorails, deep canyons and sheer rock faces, where every environment is scalable using swinging, scaling, climbing and wall-walking techniques.

I want to raise a discussion about Tower Defense gam.... wait! Don't close this tab yet! Just hear me out for a minute.
I've always been a fan of TD games, like most of the people out there, it started with warcraft III custom maps and newgrounds flash web games.

There aren't a lot of new TD's out there, but one aspect that really made TD's feel like something to really think about was the mazing aspect. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm speaking of [this](http://i.imgur.com/qup1CmQ.jpg) and [this](http://imgur.com/X67Bgm0). A way to build INSIDE the enemies path.


Tinkering with new mazes increased the complexity of the game, and added a new layer of depth to most maps. While it had different implementations, even the simplest form of creeps moving from ""A to B"", allowed you to change the way the enemies moved, prioritizing bigger paths and better areas for towers for example.


&amp;nbsp;


So, I went on a search for TD's that allowed the player to do it. And the results were... underwhelming.


Most modern TD's only allow the player to build on very specific places, resulting in the fact that the only strategy involved in a specific level were what towers you would focus, and in which spot.


Now, I'm not saying that every TD game has to allow mazing. But the number of games that I found that allowed it, wasn't great. 


The only game I found to be quite fun (and had a different style to it) was [Tower Wars](http://store.steampowered.com/app/214360/). But the game doesn't revolve much around that idea, as it revolves around spending gold to send units in  an offensive against the other player (yes, it is pvp).


Unlike the other games in this genre, this game lets you build towers in Hexes, not in squares.


It has some maps for the Classic Tower Defense mode that are quite fun, but there are only 3 (for singleplayer) and 1 (for multiplayer(which you can play alone)).
But that's it, after a while it gets stale pretty quick.


&amp;nbsp;


Me and my friend have been playing a custom map in DoTA2 called ""Gem TD"" for some months now. You might have heard of it because of it's Warcraft III version of the map.


It is also quite fun, and the most complex (in terms of mazing of all TD's that I found). Where the enemy has to go from SPAWN -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E -&gt; F -&gt; Core. And you can build a maze so that the creeps pass trought the same spot up to 6 times. And there are lots of variety to the types of mazes you can build.


The problem is that the game revolves around RNG too much, so much that it's near impossible to finish if you don't get lucky in 2 Players. And there are special towers that make the game so much more easier, but takes stupid amounts of luck to get. I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GemTD/comments/4jvc2b/probabilities_for_special_towers/) post to illustrate the chances of getting one of those special towers (Spoiler alert, one of them has a ~0,00000054% chance).


&amp;nbsp;


So my search continued, and continued... but It didn't yield good results. Found some similar games that used some of this concept, but weren't really implemented nicely (IMHO):


Fieldrunners


Sanctum


Defense Grid


&amp;nbsp;


But yeah, I'm yet to find a game to make me lose hours of my time tinkering with mazes on paper and more hours by running trought the endless waves of it. 


I could Rant for hours about this, talking about all the good examples from WarIII customs (power towers/wintermaul) but this is starting to get a bit long.


So I might end up discussing the rest on the comments.


What are your thoughts on it /r/games?

**TD:DR: Not enough modern Tower defense games with maze aspects to it**


","What happened to the ""maze"" aspect in Tower Defense games?"
Games,"**Doom (2016)**

**Release Date: May 13th, 2016**

[GamesRadar - 5/5](http://www.gamesradar.com/doom-review/)

&gt;Intelligent, involved, and relentlessly exhilarating, now, just as in '93, the most exciting FPS around is a game called Doom

[Gamespot - 8/10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-6416432/)

&gt;Many shooters chase the thrill Doom delivers, but few are as potent in their execution. It captures the essence of what made the classic Doom games touchstones of their day, and translates it to suit modern palates with impressively rendered hellscapes and a steady influx of tantalizing upgrades. Doom is the product of a tradition as old as shooters, and while it's not the model to follow in every case, modern shooters could learn a thing or two from Doom's honed and unadulterated identity.

[Destructoid - 9/10](http://www.destructoid.com/review-doom-361942.phtml)

&gt;Now all I'm hoping for is the sequel that this is a little too set up for. I'm hoping it goes the Diablo route and lets me go to a heaven dimension to blast some weird, fu.ked-up angels. Uh, sorry. I've been playing too much Doom. I'm going to go rip up a steak or something.

[Shacknews - 9/10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/94706/doom-review-like-hell-you-will)

&gt;That a first-person shooter like Doom exists in 2016 is shocking. Its levels are vast and intricately designed, its gameplay diverse and joyful, its toolset robust. Multiplayer is its weak link, but the adaptability of SnapMap is more than enough to offset that.

[GameInformer - 88/100](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/doom/b/playstation4/archive/2016/05/17/doom-review.aspx)

&gt;Driven largely by its successful single-player campaign, Doom is a welcome return to form for the genre-defining franchise. By sticking to time-worn traditions in all the right places and deftly employing some modern flourishes, id has rediscovered what made this demon slaying series so successful. Multiplayer and SnapMap don’t reach the same heights, but shooters fans shouldn’t miss this bloodthirsty romp through hell.


[PC Gamer - 88/100](http://www.pcgamer.com/doom-review/)

&gt;With Doom’s campaign, id Software found a sweet spot nestled somewhere between nostalgia and modernity that celebrates the pulpy sheen of big-budget shooters and resurrects an intense, simplified focus on the shooting itself. Doom sticks a bit too close to home to reinvigorate the genre, but it’s a reminder that FPS games aren’t limited to stop and pop corridors and political melodrama. It’s a reminder that sometimes a controlled, crafted appeal to base desires—going fast, flying high, and swift, tongue-in-cheek demon justice—are more than enough.
88/100

[IGN - 7.1/10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/doom-review-2)

&gt;Doom is a tale of two very different shooters (and one quirky creation tool). The single-player campaign's reverent worship of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend of weird and simple and endearing.


[Jimquisition - 9/10](http://www.thejimquisition.com/doom-review/)

&gt;With Doom, id has delivered a highly polished, utterly shameless Hellbound hecatomb that confidently swaggers into the world with gaudy fervor. It’s huge, it’s preposterous, and it’s absolutely bloody majestic.

[LazyGamer - 9/10](http://www.lazygamer.net/review/doom-review-riding-shotgun/)

&gt;DOOM is unrepentantly old school. It’s gore porn to the max, a ballet of bullets and blood that I can’t get enough of. Satisfyingly brutal, solid and most importantly, fun.

[Polygon - 85/100](http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/18/11706108/doom-review-PC-xbox-one-PS4)

&gt;Doom struggles somewhat to finish what it starts, and for a franchise that practically created what we understand as shooter multiplayer 22 years ago, its largely flavorless multiplayer is surprising. But on the whole, as a new interpretation of one of gaming's most formative, difficult to pin down cyphers, id has done a pretty great job in making something that feels familiar and fresh, and, most importantly, pretty damned fun.

[Digitally Downloaded - 5/10](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2016/05/review-doom-sony-playstation-4.html)

&gt;People will be talking about the first two Doom games for decades more – those two games may well be remembered as true classics of the gaming medium a century down the track. This Doom won’t. This new Doom is terrible...Like the greedy organisation that unleashes hell on Mars, this is the product of exploitation; the developers at ID Software and Bethesda are playing with fire in treating a property as valuable as Doom this way.

&gt;I really don’t like this new Doom.....While I’m not much of a fan of shooters these days.....

Games,"Overwatch came out  I think the core game of Overwatch is great. It is fun, it's different and there is a lot of strategy that can go into everything.

But with that said the actual package when you buy the game for $40 (or your regional equvialant) is lacking. There is no story elements in the game (no I'm not talking about 30 hour long campaigns I'm not about bios for each character, maps and the world), there is still no ranked mode even though there was a version of it in beta (and before people say next month, how I'm I supposed to now in game that ranked mode is coming next month?), a lack of a custom games list, no information about how much damage or healing an ability does and there isn't any rewards for winning a game except a small amount of exp. But what I really want to focus on is the lootbox system which has rng and micro transactions involved. 

This alone has made me not want to play the game. I would like more skins but the only thing from keeping me from getting more skins is RNG. I don't get money or duplicates so I can't buy the skin I want and the notion you can get duplicates is insulting especially when you consider I got a duplicate skin for a character who I only have one for skin. The things I listed above are complaints but I know they can easily change, even though it's annoying that these are things I found in the first few hours of playing, but the Lootbox system not only makes me regret buying OW for supporting a game with this shitty system but it makes me question what I'm I actually getting when I buy Overwatch.

When you buy a game (or any software for that matter) you buy the licence to use said game/software. This explain why it's legal for a company to disallow you from playing a game if you break the user agreement.

So ok your buying the contents of the game Overwatch but for some reason your not entitled to any of the cosmetics items even though they come with the disk or download. When people think this should be a F2P game they point to the Lootbox system because it is so unrelated to your ability to play the game. Why can't I get the legendary skin of a character by killing 4 people with my ult 10 times or some similar hard task to do if that is not possible for a particular character? This would make people want to play there best and as long as you don't make them kill an entire team with BLANK ability you could still avoid a lot of trolling and anger. It would also make me think I'm not just buying an expensive Lootbox Opener simulator but a game that rewards me for playing well.

Seeing someone rock that skin I don't think they earned that and I don't even think they think there good enough with that character that they would put money on getting cosmetics for them (something I did when i used to play LoL) I only know they were lucky enough to get that. In the end the lootbox system makes me think I wasted money and makes me unmotivated to play this game as I know that even if I get 5 solo hexakills a game I won't get anything out of it because I'm not lucky enough to even get the gold to buy one of the highest tiered skins for that character. 

If they want to put into a F2P game fine Dota gets away with it because it's a free game so they don't have any obligation to give you anything and CSGO can get away with it because you can argue that it's technically DLC because the original version of the game never had it. I know some people say that the Lootboxes support the game but why should I support a game that I don't want to play anymore? If that was Blizzards intention was to add micro transaction to support the game instead of charging for merchandise, comics, books, whatever there planning to do with the cinematics or single player story driven DLC. Why do they want to punish those that don't have the money or time to get a lot of Lootboxes? 

TLDR this post is very negative of Overwatch but Overwatchs core game is very good. However the Lootboxes, RNG and Microtransaction makes me hate the game because it doesn't feel like I bought a game because a huge chunk of the game is held by ransom behind one big gambling game. There is nothing currently keeping me to continue playing and continue to get better because all the ""progession"" is tried to an RNG system that favors the house.",Overwatch makes me wonder what I'm actually getting when I buy the game
Games," I made this post in response to what I'm seeing out of Valve's multiplayer titles currently. As such, I'll be focusing on their three active games: CS:GO, TF2, and Dota 2.

I'm sure that if you're veterans of Valve's multiplayer games (CS:S, TFC, TF2, DoD, etc) you'll remember at one point getting a double kill and hearing the familiar voice of the Quake Voice tremble throughout the server, or played some sort of modded game. I remember playing, specifically, Slag Gaming a lot while I still played TF2 actively. I loved their zombie fortress, smash bros, and Advanced Weaponiser. Most impressively, they made an entire new gamemode called Parkour Fortress that was completely new code-wise. Well, they're dead, and I feel sad (more nostalgic) for them because it's almost directly related to Valve's treatment of custom servers. Nowadays, Mecha Slag has moved onto more profitable ventures; he's (or she?) the mastermind behind The Hat In Time.

Anyways, what Valve did was introduce quickplay. Quickly, new players (instead of looking through the server browser that seems to be absent from every multiplayer game now) used that to match up with pretty much exclusively valve and skial servers. As a direct result, community servers pretty much died out. What used to be full 32 player custom map communities and clans became ghost towns, maybe with 2 people deathmatching it out. It was sad, and although valve eventually reverted the changes that led to the situation, it still haven't came back. For one, custom maps are rare to see. While the TF2 team is supporting them again, it seems half-hearted at best. I'm kind of rambling here, but I suppose what I'm saying is that the general feeling of custom and community servers and clans was lost as valve servers became the largest.

I'm pretty sure this story is no stranger to the veterans. CS:GO came with no server browser at all at first. While Valve quickly gave in and gave us one, it was dodgy, full of errors, and hidden away. Once again, boot up the server browser, and take a look at the hundreds of servers with the dreaded 0/32 players... Surf and Bhop still exists, but with the updates to the physics, even that seems jeopardized in what seems to be a push to get people to ONLY play what valve put in the game.

Dota 2, the newest in Valve's hit flagship titles don't even have community servers nor browsers. They didn't even try, and they have not listened to the requests to have one.

I feel sort of sad and dissapointed in Valve's treatment of community servers. So far, it seems only Battlefield still has some reminiscent of community servers. The death of the server browser and the rise of matchmaking that only places you into the game's own dedicated servers have made Custom gamemodes, mods, clan servers, and the such to slowly die out.. and, like I said, it's disappointing. While I'll always want to play some vanilla action, mods can definitely add more to the game and even better, replayability. I'm sure this is not limited to Valve's games. Battlefront had no server browser and received flak for it.

Games,"Just to name a couple examples. 

Elite: Horizons. The most common complaint about it is that it is not deep enough. ""Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle"" is a phrase often used to describe it. Lots of things to do but pretty much nothing under the surface. So a lot of people avoid it, or get bored of it rather quickly and quit.

Then on the other hand you have its polar opposite (but still in space) Eve Online.

 Spreadsheets in space. It's so deep and so complicated that the spreadsheets and databases and even player created tracking tools are a result of its complexity. When you're dealing with that sort of depth you need something to help you keep track of it all. So a lot of people avoid it, or can't keep up with the information firehose to the point that most of the game seems to be just keeping track of everything, and they get bored of *that* and quit.

Games,"I was playing through Fallout 4, and I was struck by how lame the late-game looting seemed. 99% of legendary drops were ""Slightly Pointy Knuckledusters - +2% damage when standing on your head"" or similarly underwhelming/useless drops. This is because, I assume, there are so many weapon combinations the chances of getting something that fits your playstyle, level and character is very low and you are overcome with a tidal wave of shit to cart home and sell or dismantle - not at all enjoyable.

But the converse is just as bad - too few loot itemsand you end up getting the exact same items dozens of times, an equally thankless experience.

The two most popular theories I've seen are ""The corporation you break into caused this"" or ""there was a large populous problem caused by something."" Lets take a minute and look over these two. I don't see how the corporation could have caused what seems like a global scale apocalypse the facility is clearly old and worn away lacking any kind of real security and its not like you really need to hide a facility when you rule the world. As for theory 2 I'm going to try and explain this ""something.""

Some time long before the events of the game a global destruction level flood began wiping out most of the human population and most likely would have if not for a miracle. And that miracle did happen as some one invented a machine that could control and stop water. (we can see these inventions used in certain puzzles through out the game ) Obviously who ever made this was a hero almost a god the savior of everyone. However, at that point ""everyone"" is not many people. With a city safe from flooding what was left of humanity began to explore until they found corpses they were grey and contorted by the raging water. However these corpses stood and had large fat parasites in them seemingly puppeting them to stand in a hunched over position not moving. The remains of humanity quickly found a way to control and put these slaves to use. The slaves were disposable so they could go on dangerous mining expeditions to eventually just get left behind waiting for another order. These slaves brought back the inventions of the modern age. Things like cars, computers, and even submarines could once again be used to aid humanity. However over time the corporation and new age scientists wanted to see how far new mind control technologies and the parasites could go. Using long dead children as test subjects they tried to make their own super slave that could lead others and safely breath under water. Obviously this went very poorly as the children gained their own intelligence and ripped the wires in their heads off the walls and broke free eventually destroying the machine that stopped the flood waters under the facility. Forced to abandon any one who was still there and their technology they sealed off the area to be abandoned. (A more compact version of this technology would later be used on the child to turn him into one of the water children.)

So that's my theory so far. I might have been trying to fill holes slightly to large in my post. However, with the over abundance of water even in the beginning of the game when its raining and the fact that once it becomes day it is clearly overcast lead me to believe that we only got a small taste of how much water there actually is. 

Some things I didn't really put in the post. The large shock wave portion of the game could possibly be the machine that keeps the water out or at least it could be the exhaust from the machine. From what I can tell the slaves seem to be the norm in the world with parents bringing their kids on almost what seems like a field trip to see them go through processing. The corporation also doesn't seem evil but rather misguided in their somewhat inhumane experiments.

Like I said at the start of the post I don't really have any ideas over the symbolism of the whole game like what the meat ball, the child, or the secret ending stood for but I think I have a general idea of what the world is like and why things are where they are.

**tl;dr | A large flood happens some one creates a machine we see in game that stops water. The water brings the parasites which brings a prosperous age for the new human colony. They over extend nature and create abominations.**",(Playdead's inside) The flood apocalypse theory.
Games,"One of the most consistent criticisms I hear about modern games is that they lack depth and are overly streamlined. Many claim that modern games eschew the delayed gratification of learning complex mechanics because the wider audience either doesn't have the time to learn them or because they aren't able to handle negative feedback.

Just from my own limited perspective I can think of a few recent games that don't fit this supposed trend, MGSV, Pillars of Eternity, Hitman, BloodBorne, and Alien Isolation. How true do you find this claim to be overall?",Do modern games have less depth than games from earlier gens?

The graphics are pretty nice, and the performance is very good. I think the loadout UI could be nicer, previous titles did it much better.

Has sound in gaming evolved at all in the past decade? I'm not talking artistically since there were and continue to be beautiful soundtracks ever since the NES era, maybe even earlier. I'm talking aobut the purely technical aspect that someone like myself who isn't an audio enthusiast might have missed.

Are there any new and improved standards games use now which they did not use 10 years ago? Are there any differences in sound between sequels, e.g. is the sound in the witcher 3 more advanced than that of the original game? Are there any new and exciting sound related developments on the horizon?","Games have been getting progressively more pretty for ages now, but what about sound?

Games,"I feel like already calling this game a failure may be a bad call. It's not going to be a normal Metal Gear game, but that's ok. Neither was the Acid games or Revengance.

It's not going to have Kojima, and that sucks, but I'm sure other people are capable of creating at least a decent story.

From what is told so far, it's not going to be a full $60 game, it's going to be priced similar to Ground Zeros. So for that, this game could be worth it. Even without a fantastic story, or Kojima backing it, it might still be $20 worth of fun.

One complaint with MGSV I had is that I felt like there were tons of weapons that I never needed to use, and thus didn't. A good assault rifle, silenced pistole, and sniper rifle and 90% of my missions were good to go. With this game maybe we'll have more of a reason to use some of these other well developed weapons, like shotguns and machine guns, revolvers, etc. Maybe even some of the other equipment as well.

&gt;""A game with some good experiences brought down by both technical issues and poor gameplay execution""

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Kyle Hanson - [3 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;ReCore had a ton of potential and sadly squandered a good portion of it. The game still has moments of glory, and pulls inspiration from a lot of great games of the past. It even has a very old school feel to it, with 3D platforming and combat that feels very classic, if unfortunately not delivering top of the line quality. Still, the first few hours are worth trying out, and perhaps the flaws won't be as glaring for all players. The game has a good foundation, and maybe some patches will get it close, but it'd take a complete rework to truly live up to the expectations that were set long ago.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Brett Makedonski - [4 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-recore-385972.phtml) (XB1)

&gt;It's all a shame because ReCore shows so much promise in its opening hours. It's easy to envision a way in which all those ideas could manifest into something great. They don't, though. Instead, it's just a jumble of mechanics that never jell, gameplay that grows stale far too quick, and insulting design. System failure.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Aaron Main - [8 / 10](http://gamingbolt.com/recore-review) (XB1)

&gt;If it wasn't for the extreme bugs and flaws that shroud ReCore this would be one of the best games I've played so far this generation. The good outweighs the bad. I hope for its success because this new IP deserves to be an ongoing franchise for everything new it brought to the table.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Travis Northup - [75 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/hardcore-recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;ReCore is the framework of an incredible game with some truly unforgivable technical issues, which greatly deter from the overall experience. You’ll enjoy the challenging platforming, and awesome robotic action…in between aggravatingly long loading screens, and deaths via falling through solid surfaces.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Mick Fraser - [8 / 10](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;A slick, compelling adventure only let down by a glut of technical issues that really should have been polished out.

&gt;A boring collect-a-thon and empty open world drag down Recore's strong fundamentals

--------------

**Rectify Gaming** - Tyler Nienburg - [8 / 10](http://rectifygaming.com/primed-core-recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;ReCore is great to kick off the season, despite it's feeling of being unfinished and a bit rushed towards the end.

--------------

**Rocket Chainsaw** - Andrew Cathie - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.rocketchainsaw.com.au/xbox-one/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;Overall ReCore is a compelling experience, not for its story or environments, but for its characters and art design.

--------------

**TechRaptor** - Samuel Guglielmo - [3 / 10](http://techraptor.net/content/recore-review-loading) (XB1)

&gt;There's a good game buried somewhere in ReCore, but it's lost somewhere in the massive inconveniences they throw at you. From constantly refusing to let the player move on until they complete side content (even in the middle of dungeons) to loading times that put Sonic 2006 to shame. This ensures that ReCore starts off interestingly and ends up horrid.

--------------

**TrustedReviews** - Alastair Stevenson - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/recore-review) (XB1)

&gt;ReCore has a lot of great things going for it. Joule is a likable protagonist and her robotic companions are outright adorable. The platforming exploration is an absolute blast.

--------------

**Twinfinite** - Chris Jecks - [3.5 / 5](http://twinfinite.net/2016/09/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;Ultimately, I’m left in two minds with ReCore. While its platforming and shooting gameplay was fun, if not a tad basic, the story is there to do little more than drive things forward, and the environment it all comes in is dull and not enjoyable to explore.

--------------

**USgamer** - Mike Williams - [3 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/recore-pc-review) (PC)

&gt;ReCore is a style of game we haven't seen in a while. Part Mega Man Legends, part Metroid Prime, ReCore puts exploration and platforming at the forefront. With your trusty corebot pals, you'll double jump and dash through an open world and some damned fiendish dungeons. While ReCore trips up a bit with some odd combat and gating mechanics, it's still worth your time if you remember how platforming was in the old days.

--------------

**VGChartz** - Daniel Carreras - [No Verdict](http://www.vgchartz.com/article/265808/recore-pc/) 
(PC)
&gt;Longer does not always mean better and unfortunately ReCore is one of the best examples of this maxim so far this generation.

--------------

**WCCFtech** - Francesco De Meo - [8 / 10](http://wccftech.com/review/recore-review-eden/) (PC)

&gt;With Metroid fans only getting Federation Force this year, it was up to other studios to give fans their fix, and Armature Studio &amp; Comcept did deliver with ReCore. With a well written (albeit not exactly original) story and a nicely crafted gameplay experience featuring plenty of content, ReCore is the game to get for those looking for an involving action adventure title. Sadly, the experience is a bit lessened by the generally low challenge level, which makes Corebots mechanics almost superfluous, slightly repetitive combat, disappointing boss battles and a variety of technical issues. ReCore is not Super Metroid at all, that's for sure, but it's definitely a very good starting point for a franchise that might even become big with the right tweaks.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [75%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/recore/review/) (XB1)

&gt;A smart action game with bags of personality and a few unique twists of its own, ReCore is most definitely worth investing in. It's big, sometimes difficult, fairly engrossing, and fun while it lasts.

--------------

**The Jimquisition** - Jim Sterling - [7 / 10](http://www.thejimquisition.com/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;In spite of everything dragging it down, it’s a fun ride packed with stuff to do, from optional areas to replayable dungeons to passive “hunting” quests that reward players for taking out certain enemies using certain attacks. New Eden isn’t as big as No Man’s Sky‘s universe or even Far Cry 4‘s mountainous terrain, but it’s got far more compelling reasons to stick around.

--------------

**ICXM** - Asher Madan - [9 / 10](http://www.icxm.net/x/recore-review-icxm-net-sep-13-16.html) (XB1)

&gt;Despite its technical shortcomings, ReCore’s story, combat and upgrade systems make it a thrilling and enjoyable experience. You won’t want to put the controller down once you start playing and will be a core-grabbing expert by the end.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Tamoo Hussain - [6 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/recore-review/1900-6416513/) (XB1)

&gt;I wanted to like it more, and had it not overstayed its welcome, I would have. But in the end, like its robots, ReCore is a game with a bright soul encased in parts that are used well past their prime.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Shaan Joshi - [2.0 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;While I originally had high hopes for ReCore‘s unique take on platforming and shooting, I quickly grew disappointed at how stale and tedious the minute-to-minute action became. It’s a real shame, because under all of its monotony, there are some truly enjoyable moments to be had. Unfortunately, for every worthwhile moment that ReCore manages to curate, you’ll have to wade through a sea of repetitive running and gunning in order to get there.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Sam Prell - [2.0 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;Somewhere in ReCore is a good game. Joule and her companions are instantly likable. Far Eden's tale is an intriguing one. Thanks to her agility and rocket boots, Joule is a satisfying character to control. The game's core (apologies for using a pun I'd avoided this whole review) is solid. It's just too bad that the frame supporting it isn't. 

--------------

**Gamer Headquarters** - Jason Stettner - [6.8 / 10](http://articles.gamerheadquarters.com/review476recore.html) (XB1)

&gt;ReCore had my full attention with great characters, a solid gripping story and then threw that away after a few hours.

**PCWorld** - Hayden Dingman - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3118888/software/recore-review-an-adorable-robot-dog-cant-offset-this-games-tedious-design.html) (PC)

&gt;ReCore features adorable robot companions and snappy platforming, but a chore of an end-game, bugs, and terrible load times make it a hard sell.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Matt Whittaker - [3.0 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/09/12/review-recore/225487/) (XB1)

&gt;Despite its problems, it’s not hard to envision a world in which a few changes along the way could have turned ReCore into a cult hit.

--------------

**DualShockers** - Ryan Meitzler - [6.0 / 10](http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/09/12/recore-review-a-little-help-from-my-robot-friends/) (XB1)

&gt;ReCore is a title that, ultimately, rises and falls in crafting an experience that we don’t normally see too often on Xbox (and frankly, in this generation of gaming). Harkening back to platformers like Jak and Daxter with a little bit of the flavor from Metroid titles, ReCore‘s strong aesthetic and style give way to some technical flaws and repetitive design. Much like the design of Joule’s band of Corebots, the exterior of ReCore and its gameplay show signs of age and may not be the most appealing from a first glance, but inside there’s still a core of unique qualities to make it stand out as one of Microsoft’s most interesting (though flawed) exclusives.

--------------

**Digital Spy** - Kirk Mckeand - [3.0 / 5 stars](http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/xbox-one/review/a797835/recore-review-preview/) (PC)

&gt;Like a robot that's been cobbled together from spare parts, ReCore has a complicated identity. It's often a platformer and a third-person shooter, but it sometimes feels like a shoot 'em up or a character action game, and it's all underpinned by RPG systems...Because of this muddled personality, it never fully delivers on anything, leaving us with an enjoyable experience, albeit one with a few issues at its core.

--------------

**IGN** - Vince Ingenito - [7.3 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/recore-review) (XB1, PC)

&gt;Its world, while interesting to explore for a good while, is ultimately too big with too little happening in it to be a totally serviceable housing for the strong combat and platforming gameplay within. It feels like a great, arcadey action platformer spread across too big a canvas, and it asks you to draw back over the same lines a few too many times.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Redmon Carolipio - [4.5 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2016/9/13/reviews/100672/) (XB1)

&gt;There are other odd issues to be found where ReCore keeps tripping over itself despite earnest efforts to aid the player, like a targeting reticle that appears below Joule whenever she takes big jumps — except the camera always prevents you from truly seeing it, so you end up witnessing Joule fall into chemicals or into a pit of death. I could go on, but I'll stop. Perhaps one day, I'll have Joule raid an easy dungeon with Mack just to see how they move and interact. That way, I won't die and have more than enough time to think about how disappointed I was.

--------------

**Daily Dot** - Dennis Scimeca - [3.5 / 5](http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/recore-review/) (XB1)

&gt;Victories in ReCore, whether they were rooted in platforming or combat skill always felt satisfyingly earned, and that for me was enough to balance all the frustration along the way. But if I hadn’t enjoyed the Disney-like tone of ReCore’s story and had not genuinely liked the game’s characters, my patience for ReCore’s shortcomings would probably have strained to the breaking point.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Keri Honea - [3.0 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/recore) (XB1)

&gt;The first couple of hours of ReCore were almost downright magical. The story had me on its hook, the gameplay was fun, Mack was adorable and so much fun to use in combat, and I admit that the environment initially took my breath away. A few hours later, everything fell stale. The gameplay gave way to typical dungeon-platforming formulas. Even the beauty of the characters and environment appeared to diminish, as though the game was slowly rolling back to the PlayStation 2 era. At least I had the story to keep me going, and that somewhat made it worth it to push through to the end. If ReCore had simplified a smidge, focused on its core gameplay and core values, it wouldn't be anywhere close to the loose conglomeration of half-executed ideas that it sadly is.

",ReCore - Review Thread
Games,"The other day, I submitted a[ text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/55p033/blues_and_bullets_is_likely_cancelled_after/) about 2015's Blues and Bullets, an episodic game being developed by a small studio, which likely won't see completion.  One of the themes I noticed in replies to that topic was how a lot of people consider supporting episodic titles a risk, since there are no guarantees you're going to receive a complete product.

I love episodic games, but I don't disagree, and, well, maybe there should be some consumer protections in these situations.

First off, I should say that there are indie titles that have handled the episodic model well, like The Descendants, so I don't think Crowd of Monsters' situation is indicative of how episodic games are all potential scams. Blues and Bullets seems like it is the first instance of an episodic title going through the sales model's worst case scenario, where a lot of people aren't going to receive what they paid for.  But there have been a lot of games released since Halflife 2 Episode One popularized episodic releases a decade ago, that have defined what people expect from an episodic game series.

For example, Dreamfall Chapters was excellent, but there were regularly 3-6 month gaps between episodes, meaning most people would forget the details of what happened in the last episode by the time the next one came out.  The series started in 2014, and ended in 2016, and can be completed in about 18 hours.  Similarly, King's Quest by The Odd Gentlemen has had regular 5 month gaps between episode releases, and with two more episodes to go, it will have started in 2015 and finished in 2017 if their release pattern continues.  Kentucky Route Zero's first episode came out in 2013, and there are no indications of when that game will be completed, but many fans seem content to wait.  That's fine, but I believe that people who aren't satisfied waiting around for a year or more for a game to be completed in similar situations should be entitled to a refund if they are dissatisfied.

A more grey area comes from companies that are pretty dependable, or forecast their release schedule in more definite terms than, ""when it's done.""  Telltale games release schedules have been all over the place, but they generally come out 5-7 weeks between episodes, with a few dramatic exceptions due to internal problems.  Resident Evil Revelations 2 was episodic as well, with dependable weekly releases, but that was doable because the game was completed before the first episode was put out, and it was supported by a major publisher that was also pushing a multiplayer arcade mode with microtransactions.  Life is Strange released episodes in 8-12 week cycles, which I personally feel is on the long side, but still within reason, and they met their projected release targets with absolutely minimal delays.

So the market is sort of clarifying the ethics of episodic games on its own.  I don't suggest outright that government intervention is necessary at this point, but I would argue that one of the major companies releasing episodic games needs to set the bar for how they are released in a timely fashion, and one of the major sales platforms needs to set the bar for how these companies are paid, like an escrow system that releases funds on project completion, to protect consumers against fraud.  Until that happens, it will indeed be a gamble to support indie developers through Early Access programs or episodic releases of unfinished games, there's no getting around how many Steam Greenlight titles ended up burning people.  And then there are cases like Star Citizen and other Kickstarter projects that have left backers hanging out to dry for years - maybe people shouldn't have to jump through hoops in the cases of non-delivery there as well.  You trick one guy out of ten bucks, it sucks for that guy, but it's not a real big deal.  You rip off 50,000 different people for their ten bucks in one fell swoop, that should be actionable.",Maybe there should be consumer protections for episodic and early access games.

[Attack of the Fanboy](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/paper-mario-color-spash-review/) - 4/5
&gt;Once again, Nintendo has delivered an overall enjoyable game that doesn't seem to deliver what fans may have initially expected. Putting aside expectations though, Paper Mario: Color Splash is a decidedly solid adventure-platformer, with some great storytelling and humor layered on top. The papercraft visuals are gorgeous, and the soundtrack will have you humming along in just a few minutes. The card-based battle system is a real downer though and the loss of deeper gameplay elements is still hard felt, dragging the whole experience down quite a bit.

&gt;Paper Mario: Color Splash has a lot going for it. Most of the time, it's the kind of game that simply brings a smile to your face as you enjoy the fresh world and amusing dialogue. If it weren't for the tedious side effects of the card system and the disappointingly unoriginal cast, it could be a genuine Game of the Year award contender. As it is, it's still thoroughly worthwhile for its enchanting paper world (and the attendant tunes) alone. This game is about 80% whimsy, wonder, and silly grins – which makes it worth your while to put up with the few ways that it doesn't shine.

&gt;But that's it. That's the extent of my issues with this game, and for me, the positives far, far outweigh the negatives. If you didn't like Paper Mario: Sticker Star because it wasn't like the first two games in the series, I don't think you'll be satisfied here. For everyone else willing to give it a chance, Paper Mario: Color Splash is a charming journey that will delight your senses, your funny bone, and the part of your brain that houses your nostalgic feelings towards Nintendo.

&gt;It’s no Thousand-Year Door, but Color Splash really does provide an overarching sense of consonance which was conspicuously absent from Sticker Star and even Super Paper Mario. It’s a good balance of humor, environment, variety, and casual puzzle elements. And it seems likely that, provided they can sit back and relax and reset their expectations for the franchise, the fanbase will really enjoy what it brings to the table.

&gt;Paper Mario: Color Splash is a hell of a good time. If you are able to look past a gimmicky battle system and a couple of shoehorned mechanics, Color Splash oozes with both charm and humor. Sporting a great aesthetic, it is a title that should be in every Wii U owner’s library.

&gt;Color Splash presents a beautifully crafted paper and cardboard world, populated by witty paper Toads and existential minions. Though it’s got its share of backtracking and battle system quirks, the new painting mechanics are satisfying, and the mini-story arcs are almost creative and clever enough to make you forget that your princess is (yet again) in another castle.

&gt;At its most imaginative, Color Splash's visual gags and thoughtful manipulation of 2D objects rival any ""wow"" moment from Sony's Tearaway games. What Color Splash lacks in moment-to-moment paper tricks, it more than makes up for in persistent visual appeal and a wholly adorable cast, including antagonists from all pay grades.
Its only frustrating feature is its Cutout interface, which can leave one stumped, disrupting the game's pacing and enjoyment of levels considerably. The novelty of the paint splashing doesn't grow tiresome, but it does take a backseat to the visual allure for which the series is known. Color Splash makes a solid case for a Paper Mario sequel that doesn’t need to rely on shtick like stickers or paint, though I won't be surprised if Nintendo’s considering using crayons in the future.

&gt;They say the devil’s in the detail, but Color Splash proves quite the opposite. In the minutiae it excels, while many of its broader systems hit a little wide of the mark. Despite its flaws, it’s very difficult to dislike, perhaps because every niggling issue is quickly followed by a moment of grin-inducing silliness or awe-inspiring beauty. This might not be the return to classic Paper Mario that its devotees have been awaiting, nor is it a bold reinvention that vindicates Nintendo’s need to innovate. It is, however, one of the most heartwarming games you’ll play this year.

&gt;Color Splash’s RPG elements might be paper thin, but fans of the series won’t be disappointed with this latest adventure. While the game’s combat isn’t much deeper than Mario’s paper-thin body, this plumber’s antics and colorful world are worth the price of admission.

&gt;Paper Mario: Color Splash is a step in the right direction for the series after the 3DS’s Paper Mario: Sticker Star, continuing its shift from RPG to action-adventure game while also introducing some smart changes to its battle system. The beautiful Wii U graphics and playful humor stay true to the spirit of the Paper Mario franchise, but the story is straightforward and a bit bland. Inventive level design in the second act offers some much needed diversity to some of Color Splash's otherwise linear gameplay before the disappointing third act regresses into simple and uninteresting battles. Though Color Splash still isn't back to the high points of the first three games in the Paper Mario series, it's a strong step in the right direction.

&gt;Color Splash is so damned imaginative and beautiful, though, so colorful and confidently funny. Even when it annoyed me, it was only fleetingly.

&gt;Without the drive to engage in combat, or complete side missions, I found myself purely driven by the natural progression. I enjoyed seeing new levels and unique references. I loved the way the music was tied into the experience, and I felt so strangely satisfied by colouring in all the missing spots in levels. With hours of gameplay and no two levels the same, I certainly enjoyed myself with Paper Mario: Color Splash. Just don’t expect it to play as a Mario RPG or along classical Paper Mario lines.

Color Splash is a gorgeous, funny, and entertaining adventure that functions as a wonderful swan song for the Wii U. There’s a lot of content and fun to experience here, and Wii U owners owe it to themselves to give this game a chance. It’s not a direct sequel to Thousand Year Door, but it doesn’t need to be.

&gt;The PlayStation 3 (abbreviated to PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment, formerly Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It competed with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006 in North America, and March 27, 2007 in Europe and Australia.

&gt;The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, included it being the first to introduce Sony's social gaming service, PlayStation Network, and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, being able to remote control the console from the devices. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released, being lighter and thinner than the original version, which notably featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.

Games,"I have to apologize, I meant to put a spoiler tag on this. Now the spoilers have nothing to do with the plot but I did vaguely describe a couple of weapons so it's only fair I warn anybody reading this. There is definitely nothing that would give anything away or ruin the game for any one who hasn't played yet. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I love first person shooters. There's just something about being able to jump into a combat scenario and know that no matter what happens your going to wake up just fine the next morning. When I was stationed over Iraq, it didn't always feel like that would be the case, but that's ten years behind me and I'm still here, thank God. So games like these are therapeutic in more ways than you can imagine. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was really looking for something more along the lines of Dead Space when a friend suggested Singularity to me. I'd never heard of it, so I was a little skeptical. And even after the first half hour or so I was still kind of holding it comparison to Dead Space, which if you haven't figured out is definitively my favorite go to game. But once I figured out the controls and strapped that TMD on, I was hooked. I'm sucker for time travel stories and to have a tool that can age or renew and object just seemed genius to me. It added so much more depth and, frankly without that little gadget, it would have been just like any other FPS. It reminded me a lot of Bio Shock, another favorite of mine, because Bio Shock had those little extras that brought it above you basic FPS. Also Singularity was built using the same engine, Unreal, which is perfect because any game that uses that particular engine, plays seamlessly on my system which compared to power of the machines coming out these days, it's a fossil and not even a TMD device could help it. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was really surprised that a game going on six years old could look so good. The rendering was smooth, nothing boxy, so the visuals were amazing. Game play was right on the money with an xbox controller. The cut scenes were kept to a minimum and usually rolled with the game play which I loved because there's nothing i hate more then cut scene after cut scene. Pretty much from the time you started moving you never really stopped or were forced to stop because the programmer decided to put this movie in the middle of everything really ruining the flow. The weapons ranged from basic to pretty sophisticated and fun to use and it seemed that each had a definite purpose and part of the game was realizing when it was time to swap out a weapon for another. My two favorites are the sniper rifle and the SEEKER. There's nothing like popping the head off the enemy at 300 yards with a scope of firing guided bullets around corners to unsuspecting commies or mutants. There were monsters and soldiers and all the trimmings, nobody was left out of this party. All in all I have to say I was pretty satisfied by the time I reached the end. And what I most appreciated was that the hardest boss(and he's no joke)was thrown at you in the middle of the game which at first made me think,what rip off, the game is over already? Far from it and from that point on it was more a guerrilla war with attacks coming from all sides, past and present. And like Bio shock, there were several endings, but I wont spoil everything. Only thing I found annoying was when your engaged with live soldiers, who are Russian by the way, they would repeat this same line over and over again. Some garbled Russian sounding words followed by the word Joseph. I tried hard to figure out what it was they were saying so I could translate it but I could never really make any of it out. I'm sure someone has done this already. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At any rate, Singularity was, in my humble opinion, a great game and If your looking for a good story, wonderful visuals and a pretty kick ass time with some interesting weapons and opponents, then definitely check it out. I think you'll be glad you did. And if anybody knows of any games that are like this, feel free to comment below.",Review Of the Game Singularity. It was a nice surprise...
Games,"I've never got the sensation of Let's Plays. For me, the most crucial aspect of gaming lies in the interactivity and removing that from the equation results in an improper experience. I have no problem with people enjoying commentary, nor with watching games, but what I do have a problem with is the ever-growing community of people who give their opinion on a game they haven't played themselves. The closest parallel I can draw is somebody watching a concert without audio, then proceeding to give a review of what they watched. 

One of the biggest victims of this community of watchers is Heavy Rain, a game absolutely dependent on the player being in control of the characters and choices at all times. The game has developed a sort of weird internet reputation of being a movie, when people disregard all the unique things it accomplishes because of the fact that it is a game. No movie has 24 variable endings, no movie can end with all the main characters either dead or alive. Interactivity is key when experiencing Heavy Rain, it's key when experiencing any game.

I think we are just at the tip of the iceberg of what gaming can accomplish through interactivity, it's what differentiates it as an art form. And this insistence that games can accurately be judged through watching, and should be ingested this way, will lead to stagnation of new ways to interact.

The release date for this update was December 10th, however, 3 days later players are still unable to access the game. ArcheAge has been known for failed launches in the past and has lost a lot of it's player-base due to how poorly the games publisher, Trion Worlds, handles the game. This update sought to bring back old players that had once quit with the introduction of brand new ""Fresh Start"" servers, which are servers that require a brand new account to play on, with a limited cash shop. This brought me and many other players back to the game excited and ready to give it another chance only to be spat in the face with a horribly handled launch. After 3 days the game still has a queue of more than 2k players attempting to get into these new servers, with little being done by the devs. Excuses are being thrown around left and right on Trion's behalf but the state of the game is currently unacceptable, especially considering that some have opted into their paid subscription service and are losing game time being unable to access the game.

However RE 4 went through around 6 years of development time (and this was early 2000s, so inflation of development time in mind this would be like 12 years with today's expensive technology and subsequent long development times) and got scrapped several times, with one of the scrapped designs actually ending up being a whole new game (Devil May Cry) which I definitely think is downright unheard of and unique in the video game industry.

I'm a huge fan of a game called Natural Selection 2, which is an FPS / RTS hybrid game, created by the studio currently working on Subnautica.

The game plays as a competitive team based strategy fps, inspired by things like Starcraft, ALIENS, Star Ship Troopers etc...

This video goes over some of the basic concepts of the game:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfQFykC9-v8

Up until a few months ago, you would be lucky to find a single server with people playing it, but a large resurgence of interest in the game has began to pick things up significantly, yielding about 5-10 full servers to play on at any time.

I'm basically here pleading to the reddit community to try this game out if you think it is in your possible realm of interest, as it is one of the best games I've played in a very long time, and honestly deserves to succeed on it's merit. 

I have no idea whether these guys fucked their marketing budget up for launch or what, but the game is absolutely amazing, and just not incredibly well known about.

Anyways, I hope you will give it a shot. 

It's a good enough game that it's potential failure seemed unjust enough to compel me to make a post promoting it anyways... whatever that is worth.

Games,"I do not believe there is anything inherently wrong with the Early Access model. However, I do believe it's grossly misused. A game's price should, at every point in Early Access, should reflect the game's current features. Not planned features.

The best example of Early Access was the game that started the trend. 

Minecraft. 

The game's price reflected the current state of the game. Not planned features. As planned features became playable, the price went up. When the game first came out, it was 5.00€. Then when it hit Alpha, it was 10.00€. Then beta was 15.00€. And release was 20.00€. And along every step of the way, the game gained tons of features and became more in depth. But Mojang never charged for features he hadn't finished.

Since  then, developers have tried to sell games at a $60 price tag for a game that probably isn't worth $10, if it worked at all. And then there are the Kickstarter games that have charged extra for earlier access to a game that has fewer features. 

You can wait. It's more fun to play a working game than it is to play a broken one. And it's way more fun to not be charged an arm and a leg for access to an alpha or beta that isn't even playable.

With /r/games' recent post about how games age and this month's closing of Asheron's Call, I thought this would be cool to bring up.  Puzzle Pirates is a living relic, nearly a full year older than World of Warcraft, with a way smaller but devoted player base.

Games,"What is Battle Brothers? It's a turn based strategy game where you play as the captain of a squad of mercenaries set in a low Fantasy world. With a battle map grid similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, complete with height advantage, and a world map similar to mount and blade it meshes some of the best of these two games along with many others. 

Much like M&amp;B you get that feel of just being one more soldier on the field. With a max Squad limit of 18, if you have plenty of room to build a massive squad. You manage your squads food, payment, tools, and healing items. Oh and you and your squad? A lot of you are going to die. 

With a scent from Darkest Dungeon the base difficulty is set to fuckinlit. Some of your guys will die, Not all of them, and you will be able to protect and level certain ones if your careful, but especially starting out some of your soldiers are going to end up as a corpse.

Being able to spec stats, select skills that have huge impact, and equip weapons/armor for each individual unit is just amazing. This and it's battle map system makes me feel like I'm running my FFT troop. Except better on the one hand because instead of 5 I get to have 18 of them. Yes there's no job system and not near the depth as far as spells and skills go, but with the increased party size that's kind of important. 

This game just went into early access on steam so there is that to beware of. The hours I've played in it so far have seemed perfect but I'm sure I'll come across things that need to be improved. As it's in early access this isn't really a MUST GO BUY NOW post and more just saying, if your a fan of FFT or M&amp;B and have been waiting  10 or 20 years for a sequel to either, here's a game that catches a similar spirit to both by combining them and making something that feels pretty fresh imho.

Games,"I've just realised why I've been less interested in buying release games of late. Season passes. 

In the past I sort of always knew there'd be further post-release content but it wasn't something I really considered when deciding to purchase the base game. 

But nowadays, nearly every game has a Season Pass. The example that prompted me to post this is Sniper Elite 4. Green Man Gaming already has it -25% at £29.99, which is a price I'd certainly consider getting it at. However, they also list the Deluxe edition at £51.99, a whole £22 extra, almost the entire price of what I'd be paying for the base game again. And for this season pass, an extra £22, deducting the cosmetic shit you get FOUR extra missions. 

So instead of Rebellion getting my £30 today for the game, I'll just end up waiting a few months, and getting the whole package at least 75% off for under £20. (It won't be under £20 on Steam, but one of the legit resellers will have it that cheap for sure).

I haven't picked up the Civilization DLC that was included in the Deluxe edition for similar reasons. It will inevitably be at least 50% off by summer and I'm no where near through the base game content. 

TL;DR Season passes have always been bad for consumers, but of late they seem to strike me as doing more harm to the publishers than good.",Season Passes are stopping me buying games
Games,"Hello guys,

I don't see Shadow Tactics mentioned at all around here, even though it was received with praise in the press and I'm curious about why that is. This game is so much fun and I am completely in love with it.

For those who played the Commandos series in the past, you probably remember. From the first one, Behind Enemy Lines, and its standalone sequel Beyond the Call of Duty which were a complete gameplay innovation in a completely new IP at the time, and was genre defining stealth games. Then they made Commandos 2 Men of Courage which expanded the formula even more, and finally Commandos 3, Destination Berlin, where 3D was added for interior gameplay.

I loved the many complementary abilities of each character, from Tiny the muscular Green Beret, to Spooky the Spy who could change clothes to distract enemies. I don't know if it existed before those games, but they were the first games to introduce me to the stealth genre, with the infamous enemy cones of visions.

After that, this type of game was inexistant, much to my dismay. Desperados was a refreshing take on the same genre, but I don't remember any other after that.

Enters Shadow Tactics today. This game has the exact same mechanics of those Commandos games, with even more to give, and even better execution.

First, the graphics are so much detailed, and make for beautiful environments in the Japan Edo period, also varying between sunny, rainy, snowy, and day and night. Those variations are not for the eyes only. They also have gameplay impacts. During the night, enemy vision is reduced, but is also better around sources of lights. Snow can also help/not help since walking on it leaves footprints for enemies to discover.

Second, the historical time period of Japan. I am not from Japan and I don't know much about its culture, apart from the occasional manga and anime that many know about already. The game is set in Japan's Edo period, when the country was not yet unified into a single country, but was separated between many geographically established factions. I believe many details from the period are very well represented, from the environments to the characters, even NPCs, to make for a believable story that looks like it could have happened, even if it is fictional.

Third, the characters. They are very well written, with funny quips from time to time, but also their character arc, in the many missions of the chronological campaign. You control a group of characters, very similar to the aforementioned Commandos games, with very different and very complementary abilities. They also represent different ""classes"" of people in that period, like the Ninja Shinobi, or the Samurai, and thus their dialogue is excellent in variety and interests. They each have their background story and a personality which interacts perfectly with the other members of the group and NPCs. You do end up caring for each one of them. Also, their abilities are quite good to play and feel, very fun to experiment with.

Finally the Gameplay is very slick and compact. You can play taking your time as much as you want to finish the missions perfectly. The controls also work well if you want to be quick and obtain the various badges that challenge you to play differently each mission. In particular, there's a Speedrun badge for most missions where you have to finish the mission under a timer, but also without saving! Could get some of them, and it's very fun, and as I said, the controls do not damper your abilities to do it, they're very well thought out.

So there it is, my opinion of this great game. Problem is, it is not a commercial success, at least not yet, again to my dismay. I would love to have more games like this. So much effort has been poured into making this game, I can tell, and it would be a shame if it was not rewarded for it being so good, especially when the press praises it...

There is a free demo of the game that you can get on their website, so please take the time to try it out and support these great devs!

Games,"I'm still around lvl8 in Velen, and the game just feels so drawn out and I don't even feel like playing it really. I usually go to points of interest if they are within ~150ft and do most quests within reason (in terms of geographical accessibility and difficulty) before progressing with the story.

Am I just playing it wrong? Should I just focus on the main story or would that leave me with an overwhelming sense of 'missing out' or something?

So I guess the main question is, how have any people who have finished the game been approaching this in terms of exploration/side-questing, and how frequently did you play the game?

Edit: So after reading what everyone had to say, I've decided to just not aim for points of interest. I mean, I still end up doing a fair amount of them, but since it's more organic and I don't feel compelled to do them, the game as a whole suddenly felt more fluid and natural to me. Main thing is compared to other games, having a completionist attitude in this game can really slow things down to a crawl, so it's best to just forget about that imo.",The Witcher 3 pacing.
Games,"I'll be downvoted into oblivion by the Nintendo fanboys, but thought I'd say this anyway. I am enjoying the game, I think its great fun, despite the framerate, but just wanted to try and start a discussion on this.


I was browsing the eshop awhile ago and noticed that breath of the wild has an expansion pass. I must have missed that announcement and decided to check it out. I am not against a season pass in general, because I know I don't have to buy it, and if that covers 5 pieces pf dlc and 4 suck, I can buy the other 1 on its own, usually. I often do this, as I am only ever interested in story add-ons, not cosmetics or new equipment.

The description of this expansion pass went something like this:

Available 03/03/17 - 3 chests appear in great plateau with new items and equipment.

Available 08/17 - new hard mode, cave of trials and new map functionality (whatever that means).

Availabe 12/17 - New story add-on and new dungeon

Content cannot be purchased separately.

That last line is what bugs me. Why can't I buy the story content on its own when it is released? Why do I have to pay extra for a whole bunch of content I don't want? Why does it feel like a way to squeeze a little bit more out of me when I've already bought the game, and would have been willing to buy the story content? 

Instead, this has turned me away from getting the dlc when it is released, because now with all of the extra baggage inflating the price it is going to cost more money than I'm willing to pay for what I want from it. I may be in the minority here, but I didn't want to let this slide just because it's Nintendo. 

If you decided to read this far, thanks for hearing me out. I expect to have been downvoted straight to hell by the time I wake up in the morning (it's 2:30am where I am).",The LoZ:BotW expansion pass rubs me the wrong way
Games,"Hello /r/games, I wanted to propose this discussion here and I hope we can engage in a experiment.

I got my hands in the game through a friend and having spent some time playing I can't actually say I am impressed as I thought I would be. Don't get me wrong it is not a bad game, but I don't think the scores were really fair.

**So I wanted to do this thought experiment: What if this wasn't a Zelda or even a Nintendo game? What if this was a new IP? Do you think it would still achieve this ratings with the gaming reviewers?**

I haven't played through it all yet (duh), but at the moment the game falls short in quite a few points that prevents it from being a 10/10 in my book. 

I believe this experiment/discussion could produce some interesting points and I am personally curious to know what /r/games thinks. I hope we can stay civil and respect eachothers opinions too.

Edit: Welp this actually got some nice traction, thanks /r/games. Tbh, I prefered if people did not delve too much on the reasons one think this game is or isn't a 10/10, this was already discussed a lot in the review threads and it will still be discussed a lot in the near future.

I think this is one of the better games to be released in recent years but it is definetly not without flaws. Reddit as whole sometimes fails to be nuanced when arguing a point... there should be room for discussion.

The point I wanted to make is: **How much being a Zelda or Nintendo game affected the scores?**

I personally think that some of its flaws got overlooked because of this. Others were overlooked simply because the game is that good. A similar thing happened with MGSV and its highscores, even though the game is incomplete and arguably rushed in some parts... being a Metal Gear game and with all the Kojima drama that surrounded the game, a similar argument could be made: were the flaws overlooked because all this? Or were they overlooked because the gameplay is actually insanely good? A combination of both?

I believe that if this game was a new IP it would be sitting on the 90-95 range, and it would probably be a series that people would be really looking forward the next game. Being a 9.5 game and also a Zelda game pushed it to 100.

Super late Edit: Reading this and other threads between the game was really interesting and one thing that keep getting mentioned is how other games were graded by the reviewers. Giving some thought, I am now tending to believe that my problem is with the rating system overall. One could say that there are quite a few games  that had higher scores and flaws overlooked for being in a famous series or overhyped situation.

Examples I liked of this lenience: Zelda gets a pass on having a bland MC, because it is not expected of the series to have complex characters. The voice acting that would be subpar in many games is actually an welcoming addiction for a Zelda game. The graphics issues is a bit more controversial though...

On the other hand, it is important to note that this is note a one-way street and and many argued that there is also a lot of extra scrutiny against famous series because a extra level of quality is expected.

Games,"People harp on about how Ubisoft tends to stick to their proven formula of open-world games with endless points of interest, to the detriment of their worlds, but I'd like to talk about something that I find far more troubling, and that's the almost consistently terrible but more important, misguided quality of their writing.  Ubisoft has developed/published some extremely fun games mechanically, but their story telling is absurdly bad.  

I haven't played all of their games, but the ones I have are tone def, sometimes insulting, sometimes offensive, but have bad characterization and plots.  

Far Cry 3:  Loved the gameplay, hated the story line.  I mean who wants to play as an annoying white tourist mowing through thousands of native islanders to find their travel mates?  

Assassin's Creed:  Might get some flak for this, and I haven't played them all, but no denying that it's a hackneyed mess.  Having tried to research it for a clickbait article I once wrote, it was impossible to try and catch up after the first 2.  Plus, the virtual reality concept is...I dunno, it rubs me the wrong way.

Watch Dogs:  Another game with fun gameplay, but too much effort spent trying to make an edgy protagonist who ends up being wholly unlikeable.

Ghost Recon: Wildlands:  Haven't played this one, but this quote from polygon's review is what prompted me to write this - 

""The mechanical experience of it is as freewheeling a sandbox as I've ever seen, but the frame, the tone and the script weigh it down like an anchor. While the winding roads and pastoral villages of Bolivia make for a great backdrop, it’s a backdrop seen exclusively from down the barrel of a gun and between the blinders of a trashy action movie aesthetic.""

Their smaller budget games seem to fair a bit better, but even games like Valiant Hearts, which were fairly praised, I found to be somewhat heavyhanded.  Still, the problem seems to mostly be with their AAA productions.  What gives?",What's up with Ubisoft's Writing?
Games,"Hello all,

Over the span of today I've been reading through posts here and over at r/masseffect about the Mass Effect: Andromeda early access thing and the first impressions that a lot of media outlets are releasing.

Naturally this is leading to some rather tense conversations and a lot of ""Canceling pre-orders"" or ""You gotta realize that XYZ"" comments.

So I just wanted to take a second and put out some reminders about Mass Effect: Andromeda and why both sides need to chill a bit. 

&amp;nbsp;

***First, why did you pre-order at all?***

If you're an uber-huge Mass Effect then yeah, pre-ordering a collectors edition or some such thing kinda makes sense. But for those inbetween, either those burnt from ME3 or just wary in general, why pre-order at all? 

You lose out on very little by not pre-ordering. Let the reviews from people you trust roll in before you make a purchasing decision. If you're really worried cancel your pre-order and then just use the money anyway to buy it a week or two after release. If you're really excited why not cancel just to be sure? It can't hurt you in any way. 

The embargo they put up is anti-consumer. So there's no reason you can't cancel your pre-order and just buy it after all of the reviews come out and you can make a good decision. 

&amp;nbsp;

***Second, yeah the faces are janky, some people don't mind, some do***

As I'm sure you all noticed some of the animations and facial work in Andromeda is...[Interesting](http://puu.sh/uLSlG/4a092b1064.jpg) *Shudders*

This bothers some people, and that's okay. For some people it's not a big deal, to quote my friend when we were discussing it today:

*""Facial animation is never going to be good in an RPG so you just kind of have to accept that as an RPG fan. Bioware may be worse than others but still, they look pretty bad but it's nothing I can't get over.""*

&amp;nbsp;

***Third, The story may be slow in the beginning.***

Some people and some outlets are saying that the story in the beginning of the game is slow, is an exposition dump, that everyone's boring, etc. That may be true.

Some people are saying that's par the course for Bioware, that it'll get better. This may also be true.

If you don't wanna slog through a bunch of hours of exposition and set up, then don't. Don't buy the game. Or wait until reviews come out. Or just play multiplayer. 

If it's gonna bug you, don't buy it. But there's no reason to get uppity with people who still wanna see it through. 

Also remember some people may enjoy the story and characters while you don't, that's okay. 

&amp;nbsp;

***Fourth, everyone's first impressions are wrong, and everyone's first impressions are right***

Beyond the media outlets there's also a lot of people reporting in on how they feel about the demo you can play on access right now. 

Some of these people are being helpful and putting their two cents, some negative, some positive, usually a mix of both. And they're being attacked for it.

**These are their opinions, you may not share them when you play it**

For the love of god relax. This is just their opinion, it may not be yours. Don't attack them, have a discussion with them! Ask how it compares to other games you can put as a reference. For example someone in a thread said enemies are bullet spongey. Is that compared to say the earlier Mass Effects or the Division? That will help you more than going crazy will.

&amp;nbsp;

***Fifth and finally, don't be a jerk. Opinions vary.***

Not everyone is going to like this game no matter what. But let's have a good discussion about it. You will like things others don't, or visa versa. And that's okay. You can buy the game and enjoy it, or you can ignore the game and move on. 

Some of us are huge ME fans, some of us are former fans, some of us are newcomers, and some of us hate the ME games. 

**THAT IS OKAY**

Stop being a jerk, learn to relax, wait for reviews to drop, and make a good buying decision. If you enjoy the game great! If you don't, I'm sorry.

***TL;DR***

Games,"I've been pretty disappointed with the crop of games that's out so far for Vive and Oculus. There have been a lot of tech demos and minigames but few ""real"" ""full"" games (if you'll pardon the elitism). 

Today it occurred to me that some classic GameCube games have absolutely perfect perspectives and HUDs for VR - particular, Metroid Prime and Star Wars Rogue Leader (cockpit view). 

I know these games can now be reasonably run on emulator at modern resolutions. How difficult would it be to make the leap to VR? 

Metroid Prime Trilogy edition has Wii motion controls with weapon ai somewhat detached from camera control. Is it feasible to adjust them to VR motion control? Because Samus's first-person helmet HUD and visor swapping are PERFECT for a VR experience. 

Rogue Leader's cockpit camera with in-ship computer display could get away with standard controls and minor head tracking and give you the feeling you're sitting in a fighter cockpit in heated space battle. (Rebel Strike is more problematic for its third person on-foot levels). 

Is it possible or feasible? Is it something that can be done with control tweaks instead of a whole new engine? Because I would literally shit myself in excitement. ",Is it feasible to port old games to VR headsets? Because Metroid Prime or Rogue Leader would be INCREDIBLE.

&gt;Black &amp; White 2 is a video game developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It blends real-time strategy, city building and god game elements. It was released in October 2005. A Mac OS X port was released in January 2009, and released for download via the Mac App Store in November 2014. It is the sequel to 2001's Black &amp; White, also the brainchild of Peter Molyneux.

&gt;In the game, the player takes the role of a god called from the void (nothingness) to help those who invoked them. However, the player is not an omnipotent style god, but rather a god who rises and falls with his believers and the player must help develop their nature according to their good or evil desires. The player also has a creature, their physical representation in the world, which takes the form of an anthropomorphic ape, lion, wolf, turtle, cow, or tiger. Its physical manifestation can grow to an immense size, and adopt a good or evil persona separate of the player's. They develop their character as the player rewards or punishes their actions. In addition to the god simulation and city-building elements introduced in the original Black &amp; White, Black &amp; White 2 also features elements of real-time strategy gameplay, with the addition of controllable warfare and fighting units.

Games,"Disclaimer: Before I am labelled a basement dwelling neckbeard keyboard warrior, I'd like to say that I'm all for diversity in games on every line. It improves the games they are in when employed properly, which is why I wanted to set up this discussion. 

----------------------------------------------------------

Ive come across a number of comments which have been heavily downvoted which say that racially/sexually diverse characters in games are put there to fill a quota/push an agenda. 95% of me knows this is quite an ignorant statement, but the other 5% of my can _sort of (?)_ see where it comes from. 

With the release of games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata, Watch Dogs 2, Mass Effect: Andromeda etc, ive been seeing more of these comments popping up. Was the choice to have the protagonist/characters they way they are so simply check a diversity box or were they actually there to enrich the game. I believe this is a valid question to ask. 

[_Aside: Personally, the games would not have been as good as they were without those characters in question, but I still want to ask this for the sake of discussion. Ideally, we would be apathetic to diversity in games (as in bringing it up in reviews/commentary as its own talking point) and perform character analyses disconnected from a superficial trait._] 

As we all know, many games without significant character creation setups fall back on **generally** white, **generally** male protagonists and I am certainly not the first to say that it can get stale. However, I would say that even within the peach coloured sea of testosterone, there are some stand outs and that comes down to how they were written. My choices are Joel (Last of Us) and Nathan Drake (Uncharted). Compared to them, who can remember off the top of their head the name of the leads in the last Call of Duty/Battlefield campaign? Even when they are name brand middle-aged white males, they are memorable because they are written well (better than the competition atleast). The discussion here would be, would the games have been better if the protagonist/characters were female or of a different ethnicity? It is difficult (or even futile) to attempt to answer this. The focus of the games' would be significantly changed if the protagonist was changed. Somehow conveniently, there are two contrasting games to help me with this: Telltale's The Walking Dead, and rebooted Tomb Raider. Joel vs. Lee; Nathan vs. Lara. [_My choices for the game are not based on gameplay but rather characters and story. I find it harder to imagine the latter characters in each pair to be box ticking because Lara Croft's Tomb Raider is a established franchise and I give Telltale enough credit to make an artistic choice._] Each pair has a similar_ish_ setting but the execution is vastly different and varies depending on the stories that want to be told.

As such, I believe writing/performance is more significant an issue than the diversity of characters themselves. Assassin's Creed 3's Connor Kenway was a surprising non-white character for the series, with an interesting colonial backstory, however he was a bad character due to poor dialogue/performance. Assassin's Creed 4's white-bread Edward Kenway had a better developed personality and as such was a better protagonist. 

Mass Effect (and Bioware games in general) is a series that has to be brought up when discussing diversity in games. The series has seen a varied cast in every form, yet faces issues, mostly coming from people who do not want a gay/alien/non-white shipmate, but also in part from some poor writing and shallow characters. More props to you to have a gay and black dude (someone had to fill double duty) but if thats his only character trait, then its just a waste.

Was Marcus a better protagonist than Aiden (in their respective Watch Dogs games) because he was black, or because he was better fleshed out? Would Horizon Zero Dawn have been better with a male protagonist? [_For the record, hell no_]. Are characters like Bayonetta/2B ""problematic"" examples of diverse characters because of their hypersexualised nature or does it deepen their personality? There are many games to look at and questions to be asked, but we must start somewhere. 

[_Incidentally, whats the consensus on Zelda's character in Breath of the Wild? I for one liked the way she was written, although I believe they overplayed her failures and made her come off as very depressed, like all the odds were stacked against her._]

The gist of my thesis is, the characters in your game can be as white as snow, as dark as the night, or every colour of the rainbow, but if they arent good characters, it doesnt matter. We should start to move from simply demanding more diversity and ask for more nuanced, better written characters as they are what make or break the game.

Games,"First of all, mixing MCU with comics is a fine combination for the game..BUT am I the only one who found the 1st chapter kinda weak?

Don't get me wrong, I liked the humor, using Livin' Thing from ELO as a theme music, the character's behaviours, dialogues but the choices and plot is kinda weak and shallow.

I confirmed that Drax had his vengeance, promised Meredith Quill and chosed Gamore to help me in Kree Warship. Although I was quite satisfied with my choices, the percentage with other other choice was way to high. This made me think that the choices were way too 'obvious'.

Games,"For those out of the loop, [Retro Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Studios) is one of Nintendo's first-party internal teams. One of the unique things about the studio is that it (along with Nintendo Software Technology in Redmond, WA) is based out of the United States, instead of Japan. They are the creators of the Metroid Prime Trilogy, Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze, and co-developed Mario Kart 7. 

Currently, their hasn't been any announcement to what Retro is working on. After reviewing the release dates of Retro's games, between Tropical Freeze and today, it's now been the longest stretch of time since they've released a game. 

What's particularly interesting about Retro as a studio is that they barely have any media. Interviews with employees are pretty rare, their website is bare on content, and career opportunities (unlike some studios) don't give a guess as to what they are working on. 

Speculation: I don't believe Retro is working on Metroid, because Kensuke Tanabe stated the next proper Metroid [would be on the Switch](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-17-next-proper-metroid-prime-would-likely-now-be-on-nx), and it confirms that Prime 4 isn't in current development. 

If you're wondering, Retro did have a slight artistic role in Federation Force by [supervising the design of the mechs](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/kensuke-tanabe-on-metroid-prime-federation-force/page-2). ",It's now been over 3 years since Retro Studios last game. Do we have any idea on what they're working on?
Games,"#[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind)

-------------

&gt;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is an open world fantasy action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the third installment in The Elder Scrolls series of games, following The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, and preceding The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It was released in North America in 2002 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox. The main story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind, which lies in the empire of Tamriel and is far from the more civilized lands to the west and south that typified Daggerfall and Arena. The central quests concern the deity Dagoth Ur, housed within the volcanic Red Mountain, who seeks to gain power and break Morrowind free from Imperial reign.

&gt;Morrowind was designed with an open-ended free-form style of gameplay in mind, with less of an emphasis on the game's main plot than its predecessors. This choice received mixed reviews by some members of the gaming press, though such feelings were tempered by reviewers' appreciation of Morrowind's expansive and detailed game world. Despite that, Morrowind received both critical and commercial success, winning various awards, including game of the year, as well as selling over four million sales worldwide by 2005. The game spawned two expansion packs, known as Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Both were eventually repackaged into a full set and titled Morrowind: Game of the Year Edition, which released in October 2003.

Games,"I remember back in the day, procedural generated meant hours and hours of fun, because you can't get large hand designed maps given they take up way too much space.

Now, when a game touts large play area, or procedural generation. All I can think of is they either have no or too little level designer...

Look at Skyrim vs Oblivion vs Morrowind, Oblivion had a lot less area, but many of them were hand crafted. Same with Oblivion vs Morrowind. Or FO4 and FO3 vs FNV and FO1/2, handcrafted world with strongly interconnect quests vs a bunch of stories that is in the same universe connected by the same overworld spread way too thin. 

Then, even better, with all the rougelite / rougelikes, and the galaxy sims out there, all of it went to shit.

They all try to mix procedural generated maps and designs with traditional game rules that usually don't work. 

Look at Diablo 2 / 3, the key to it's game system is that you are rewarded each play thru, and the generation only kicks in to keep you entertained with different maps each time. The game's mechanics means that you infinitely progress and there is always a reason to keep going.

Then look at Strafe or NMS, one mixes procedural with pure FPS, whereby each run you don't gain much if anything towards your progression. Or the one that mixes exploration with procedural. Not realizing that to make exploration fun you have to have fun and exciting thing to discover, which procedurally generated samey stuff usually isn't. 

So I plead with you, consumers and game makers, stop buying and making these kinds of games. I am fed up with these kind of attempts at cutting manpower and level designer as a lazy way out. If you are doing procedural, at least have it make sense and a core part of your game play loop.


/rant ",Procedural generated and games with larger game areas to me now means a game cheaply made and lacks a team of level designers

For an indie game, it's quite amazingly polished, and very addictive. I've been waiting for the release ever since I cleared the beta, and today it releases!

Games,"We were invited to a private event yesterday in NYC and got to play some new Switch games. We thought it would be cool to answer some questions people may still have about these games since it's all still fresh in my mind.

We were only allowed to record footage from Mario, and Fire Emblem but got to see and play a whole lot more.

**QUICK RUNDOWN ON THE GAMES**
-
**FIFA 18:**

Not a sports fan but it plays pretty much like the PS4 game. Not exclusive Nintendo feature other then handheld mode but definately NOT a waterd down port.

**Mario Odyssey:**

The game is great. You can play it using the pro controller. All ammibos will work and do something. Expect a LOT of costumes. Moi Moi Mario hums the background music.

**Metroid (3ds)**

HOT DAMN does this look good in 3D. The opening cuscenes mixes 3D video with 3D cutscenes w/ artwork. Plays good, 3d works well and somthing was hinted that the game is much bigger than we think it is. Not just a 1:1 remake.

**Mario&amp;Rabbits**

Much more tactical then I origonally thought. Over 200 weapons. The cutscenes are GOOD, a lot of expression and humor. Baby Bowser is confirmed in making an appearance. All enemies are Mario Baddies Combined with Rabbits. Like there was a bad Rabbit that merged a Rabbid with a Parhana Plant. You don't ""kill"" them they get ""captured""

**Fire Emblem Warriors:** 


If you like the Warriors game, you're in for a treat. You can swap character at will. You can team up with characters and do duo attacks or run around the map with them at your sides. You can level up. There WAS a bit of lag but it wasn't a complete build. There was japanese auido with english subs. English VO is being worked on but they didn't confirm that the US will be able to select between english and japanese (but they also didn't say no).

**Other Cool things:**


Got to play with the new 2DS XL! Saw some Pokken, Splatoon 2, ARMS, MiiTopea and I think the Sushi game there but we weren't able to play / record them due to time/restrictions.

--------------
Sorry for the messy formatting I'm not on my main PC right now. We put up gameplay footage we capture for Mario. Fire Emblem Warriors will be up tomorrow. https://youtu.be/VsCD3udNixM

[We Got This Covered - 4.5 / 5](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xii-zodiac-age-review/)

&gt; Whether you memorized every map of the original game, or you've yet to set foot in the most intricate version of Yasumi Matsuno's Ivalice ever rendered, there's more than enough incentive in Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age to jump in.

[Twinfinite - 4.0 / 5.0](http://twinfinite.net/2017/07/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review/)

&gt; If you absolutely couldn't stand the gameplay of Final Fantasy XII, The Zodiac Age's improvements may not ultimately be enough to sway you to the other side. However, the remaster makes some truly important quality of life changes to its design that results in The Zodiac Age being much more approachable.

[Game Revolution - 4.5 / 5](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/339847-final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review-opening-gambit)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is an excellent remaster with plenty to offer fans new and old. If you never experienced the game during its heyday or simply couldn't get past some of its shortcomings, The Zodiac Age is a perfect way to re-enter the game or start from scratch.

[IGN Spain - 9 / 10](http://es.ign.com/m/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-ps4/120783/review/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-analisis-para-ps4)

&gt; An RPG masterpiece that dreams to be online, but lies within offline walls. That makes this game different and special, making it as valid today as it was 10 years ago.

[Push Square - 9 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/final_fantasy_xii_the_zodiac_age)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is a near perfect reworking of a PS2 masterpiece. The game's not without its minor flaws, but overall, this is a startling reminder of how magical Square's beloved series can be.

[TrustedReviews - 8 / 10](http://www.trustedreviews.com/final-fantasy-12-the-zodiac-age-review)

&gt; Square-Enix hasn't pulled off any miracles with this remaster, but The Zodiac Age gives players one of the great Final Fantasies, looking sharper and playing better than it ever has before. The battle and progress systems that once infuriated aficionados haven't become less abrasive with time, but they also help give the game its pace and a feel that's unlike any other game in the series. More immediately entertaining than FF13 and surprisingly innovative and forward-looking for its time, FF12 has worn very well. If you didn't get a chance to play it a decade ago, now's your chance.

[GamingBolt - 9.0 / 10.0](http://gamingbolt.com/final-fantasy-12-the-zodiac-age-review)

&gt; While the story and storytelling have not aged all that well, the rousing musical score, surprisingly strong visual direction, and its incredible, incredible gameplay, all cement this game's place as a modern classic.

[Digitally Downloaded - 5 / 5](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/07/review-final-fantasy-xii-zodiac-age.html?m=1)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII's willingness to be different and innovative has left it feeling every bit as modern and poignant now as any new JRPG on the market, and it remains my favourite game within a series that I hold very precious to me.

[IGN - 8.8 / 10.0](http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII's relatable roleplaying adventure has aged remarkably well, and The Zodiac Age remaster improves it further in meaningful ways. The storytelling, visual design, and gameplay feel just as fresh and interesting as they did over a decade ago, and the various new enhancements and adjustments will give new players a chance to experience the magic for the first time and fans of the original something enticing to return for.

[PlayStation LifeStyle - 9.0 / 10.0](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-12-ps4-review-reading-the-signs-ps4/)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is an excellent example of a holistic approach to producing a well-made remaster. Not only does it feature the usual remaster fare of significantly improved visuals up to their maximum capabilities but it also includes significant and positive improvements and additions to its audio and gameplay that take into consideration both its past strengths and weakness, the resources of the current times, and both its past and current potential audience. Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is undoubtedly a remaster worth playing for both newcomers and fans of the original.

[Destructoid - 8.0 / 10.0](https://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-445226.phtml)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age, despite my misgivings, is a triumph that still holds up all these years later. Modern conveniences like upping the tempo of combat are far more valuable than the new coat of paint, and despite a slow-going narrative it's a blast to just roam the open countryside, mess around with Gambits, and go on hunts. Slowly but surely XII has wormed its way into my heart -- it only took 11 years.

[GamesRadar+ - 4 / 5](http://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-12-the-zodiac-age-review/)

&gt; The Zodiac Age allows Final Fantasy 12 to realize its full potential, thanks to a wealth of graphical enhancements, a soaring soundtrack, and the addition of the Zodiac Job System.

[DualShockers - 9.0 / 10.0](http://www.dualshockers.com/final-fantasy-xii-zodiac-age-12-reivew-ps4/)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII is an epic, sprawling tale that many gamers — myself included — missed the first time around because of when it was released. Don't make that mistake again. Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is one of the best, if not the best, remaster of a Final Fantasy game in recently memory, and is objectively better now than it was a decade ago. For $49.99 on PlayStation 4, the game is a steal to fans new and old interested in an old(er)-school JRPG experience.

[Hobby Consolas - 85 / 100](http://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-final-fantasy-xii-zodiac-age-ps4-153814)

&gt; Although the remastered work it's just correct, all the changes and additions (especially those from the International Zodiac Job System) makes The Zodiac Age the definitive version of one of the most underrated and special Final Fantasy.

[Wccftech - 7.0 / 10.0](http://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-old/)

&gt; If you played Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age back in the day and want to go back for nostalgia, you'll love this. If you're a new player interested in playing for the first time – keep in mind that this is definitely a game that shows its age. Though, if you have sufficient patience, it's a story well worth investing in.

[PSX Brasil - 95 / 100](http://www.ps3brasil.com/analise/912/)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is a well deserved remaster of one of the best, yet most underrated, RPGs of all time. If its original release at the end of the PS2 life cycle/beginning of the PS3 era made it fly under the radar of many, this is the perfect opportunity to experience a game that, even a decade after its original release, aged incredibly well and surpass, with flying colors, many of the games released in the past few years.

[Attack of the Fanboy - 4.5 / 5](https://aotf.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review/)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age is the shining example of how remasters should be -- improving the game in multiple aspects while keeping the core gameplay intact.

[USgamer - 4.5 / 5](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review)

&gt; Final Fantasy XII has really managed to get its hooks into me this time around, which I credit to Square Enix's excellent remaster. If you missed it the first time around (and you probably did), then now is the time to give this underappreciated gem a second chance.

[Polygon - 8.5 / 10.0](https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/10/15946228/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review)

&gt; And I am going to keep doing things in The Zodiac Age. It's taken the game I already loved so much and given me more. The Zodiac Age doesn't add things for the sake of adding them. I can see myself putting 300 more hours into this version of Final Fantasy 12, trying different combinations of job classes and testing out new tactics on the optional bosses I could never quite conquer in the original game. The Zodiac Age takes a game I could play in my sleep and makes me wake up and appreciate it again.

&gt; As it stands, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is a remaster worth checking out. It might not be the best looking re-release of a classic, but there's more than enough for fans and first-timers alike to revel in.
",Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age - Review Thread
Games,"I finished Get Even last night, and I thought it was quite interesting. Like a strange mashup of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, The Evil Within, Condemned, and ""The Nameless Game"", with a very British twist on things, which I felt was interesting from a Polish developer.

It's clearly a lower budget production, but I felt it was put together pretty well, and the acting was universally top notch.

Cole Black reminded me of Cole Phelps from LA Noire, in that players tend to project positive attributes onto the protagonist and tend to assume the best of them. Cole Phelps was a coward and a poor leader and a fundamentally weak man. This revelation, which openly manifested in him cheating on his wife, came as a shock to players who had thought they were playing some kind of morally upright straight shooter of a detective.

Cole Black -- the player proxy -- are responsible for everything. They are the ""puppet master"" that the voices chant about in the asylum. Other people in the story are guilty in their own way, but you set the wheels in motion. You raised the stakes. You put the wrong people in the wrong places at the wrong time, and then you tried to murder your way out of the mess you'd created. When you play the opening sequence, you are led to think you're some kind of grizzled mercenary trying to save a kidnapped girl. But in reality, you're the man behind the entire kidnapping scheme trying to ""fix"" a situation that has spiraled completely out of his control.

Get Even is really about guilt. And this is a common theme in horror/thriller games, but Get Even does it quite well. For the first half of the game, the evidence convincingly points to Black being an unwitting pawn in a larger game. A faithful employee who was mislead by the GUILTY real villains whom he openly defied. Whom he heroically risked, perhaps even ultimately lost his life against. But nothing is as it appears on the surface. It's like Rocky the Rooster's, ""I didn't lie. I merely omitted certain truths.""

Also, I must mention the audio design. Really good. There was an excellent sequence in the game where you're wandering around with nothing but a distant voice saying, ""Black"" over and over and over again, coming from an uncertain direction. It reminded me of the train sequence in The Nameless Game. There's a sense of ""this isn't right..."" that permeates the game. There's a ticking that appears in the soundtrack at various points. The ticking of the bomb that blew up in your face. At one point you're suspended in space walking along the hands of a giant clock. The visual design is quite inventive, and it stretches beyond what you'd expect from a lower budget game in terms of locales both ""real"" and not so real.

Get Even isn't really a horror game, but it's artfully unsettling in the right places, without every really cheap or jump scarey.

The final twist was basically the same twist as Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. That ""we"" are in fact the daughter, not the father. But Get Even added multiple layers to this. We are the daughter viewing the memories of the father who viewed the memories of his employee. And these layers bleed together throughout the game in a way that doesn't fully make sense until the last hour or so. The timeline is mixed up. And this leads the player towards false conclusions. Quite a few key story elements are heavily foreshadowed in the first hour, but the game does a decent job of preventing them being too obvious, IMO. The misdirection using partial truths was effective.

I think that from a story perspective, Get Even was really good. Probably the best game story I've played this year, and I think it will be the game's legacy. I especially liked how just when you thought it was wrapping up, you switched perspectives to Robert for the true revelations, before switching perspective to Grace for the final ending.

I think the game's shortcoming would be that it's a far better FPS game than a stealth game. The stealth mechanics are severely underbaked and lend themselves to trial and error, which can be frustrating. The game also bases its ending on whether you followed instructions or not. Shooting people is not following instructions. And while I think the stealth needed work, I do think that allowing the player to choose violence with story consequences is perfectly valid. Nobody's saying you can't shoot all these people. But be willing to face the consequences of that. Some people seemingly react poorly to that because they want total freedom with no narrative consequences.

I think it will become a bit of a cult classic down the road, but I think the game will have a bit of a problem explaining what it is without ruining the twists, and players nowdays don't like that. They tend to demand to know WHAT a game is. Games don't have the same freedom as films, especially thrillers -- do in that regard. The game is intentionally enigmatic. And there are game mechanics that aren't usable until you switch to Robert during the last act. It's a game that lies to the player because the character they are playing is in denial about certain inconvenient facts. They are lying to themselves about who they are, what they are doing, and why they are doing it. And this applies as much to Robert as Cole. I think that's a bit hard to sell to players, which is unfortunate but inevitable. On a certain level, maybe the game would have worked better as a film. However, the element of player choice and discovery would have been lost, so although it has gameplay shortcomings, I think the story was quite well served in game form.

edit:

Regarding the endings.

I've seen multiple people complain that they shouldn't be ""punished"" for using guns, but I think that's completely missing the point of the game. There is no ""good"" ending in Get Even. There is no ""bad"" ending. It's about whether you were resistant to what was essentially mind rape. Trying to divide that into ""good"" or ""bad"" does it a disservice, I think. The game itself never uses any such terminology.

Games,"Hi gamers.
Well, I noticed there were few archived posts about, but no open recent ones.

In short: I feel anxiety and avoidance of achievements and trophies.
I feel that knowing that there are lots of things I don't like to do but feel unsatisfied because some trophies require me to do, like hc or mp/pvp ones. or that silly ng+ even for plot based games just hoarding endless levels or skills.
yes, talk about witcher 3, mass effect, skyrim. totally meaningless to me, just start a new char/ class instead of more levels, more gear, more something..or high caps you don t reach or don t enjoy enough before real content ends (but it s another question, self OT)

Lately, i've been skipping multiplayer games because of pressure, screaming kids, responsibility towards my team or the unpausable pace.
I'm a OC personality, with tendencies to avoid potential ""completion rage"" that i can t fulfill in online games...and I mainly like landscapes and lore, more than competition or combat manual skills.

I just feel that even my relaxing single player games are infected by competition and comparation to others.
anyone else feels same?

Games,"G'day /r/games!

I'm back again this week with some stats on games released on Steam between the 19th and 25th of June this year. Here it is: http://imgur.com/Z3J7EI0

After spending almost 3 years in Early Access Dungeon Defenders II comes out on top in this week's stats. As is typical for games with extended betas/early access periods like this one the 1.0 week wasn't hugely impressive although it was a modest improvement on the months before it. That improvement has remained over the last couple weeks though, which typically isn't the case for most big releases.

The now 8 year old Killing Floor made a come back thanks to it being free through the Humble Bundle store's FPS sale. Whilst the resurrection peaked hard at around 13,000 concurrent users (which would put in the top 30 games on Steam) it's been slowly dwindling over the past couple weeks. It's not down to the pre-sale numbers just yet but I wouldn't expect it to last more than another couple weeks.

Games,Hi! I just want to ask about this game that I played when I was a kid. It's a shooter game similar to Platypus where you control an old man piloting an airplane and battles with chicken enemies and such. I don't know if it has a similar style to Platypus where they are made of clay or something. Please notice me!,Horizontal Scrolling Shooter Game
Games," For two years, I have been developing exploits for economic games, Gps games and more, always looking for intriguing ways to reach the top of leader-boards.

These strategies and tools have ranged from having multiple accounts to accessing the API of games, where I take advantage of absent encryption. It’s shocking to see my data transferred without added protection, sometimes even finding my password and email address in the open.

Which is why I’ve taken to writing; a process that will both consolidate my adventure of game exploitation and attract the attention of developers, players and more.

API — using the game’s commands to cheat

An API is an application programming interface used to access the data of an application. I’ve found that if you figure out the commands for actions within games, you can easily re-send these yourself and even edit them. For example, a recent game I’ve started playing has the following command: ‘AddUserVirtualCurrency’ which is accompanied by ‘{“Amount”:9,”VirtualCurrency”:”HC”}’.

I can just edit the amount from ‘9’ to ‘99’ allowing me to continue making money in-game without having to fight, tap or buy currency. With the right application, you can even automate the process and print money while sleeping.

Online games are the target

Each tool and exploit is better suited for a type of game, and this API process is best suited for online games. There’s usually a considerable amount of data being sent to and from the server, making it easy to obtain commands and details.

The best example is an economics game I played where you buy properties around the world and compete with other payers. By automating the creation of new accounts and levelling them up to get cash, I was able to reach #1 out of millions of players and also sell in-game currency.

This truly is a powerful tool.

**What will I do next with this powerful tool?**

I want to inform developers around the world about this vulnerability, mainly because certain games have put players data at risk. Too many time shave I seen players emails attached to leader-boards, which is an invasion of privacy considering that they send this data to each player.

I hope that a vast amount of developers will wish to contact me and pay for my insight because it’s an exciting process that will help many secure their systems.

However, I am more than happy for players to contact me to learn about this process since it isn’t illegal (the game sends the data to you, and you send it back, just like an app).

Thank you for reading and here are my contact details:

Games,"Hello /r/Games, I'm the creator of CUBeKA, which released recently on Steam for $5.  A solution to each puzzle is a single word.  The game comes with 94 puzzles total (30 beginner, intermediate, expert, and 4 impossible).  Beginner puzzles give 1 letter to start off with, intermediate doesn't provide a letter, expert removes clues, and impossible provides the bare (or close to) minimum # of clues while still having a unique solution.

Currently my favorite puzzles are from Zachtronics, Spacechem being my favorite by far (100% completed with all achievements).

Hell, it's gotten to the point where I commonly hear it referred to as the CoD of WRPGs, and I have no problems with that, because it sure as hell seems like it.",What is your unpopular gaming opinion?
Games,"Whenever this game is brought up here, I frequently see people criticize the amount and cost of its DLC, which to be fair totals to nearly $80 on top of a $60 base price game. However, not only have these DLC been generally of good quality worth their asking price, how Creative Assembly has handled their release has served to strengthen the community rather than divide it between the haves and have-nots. This has been accomplished in two ways.

**1. All players can experience DLC upon release**

WH2 DLC comes in the form of either lord packs that add new leaders (Legendary Lords), units, and mechanics to existing races or race packs that add entirely new races to the game. But regardless of whether or not you own them, you will still see and fight against these new lords/races in your campaign. It's even possible to get some of the new units without the DLC if you merge your faction with an AI controlled one later in the campaign, at which point you gain control of all their armies, new units and old. You just can't recruit them yourself unless you own the DLC.

**2\. DLC releases are always paired with content updates/additions for all players**

Almost every time CA has released a DLC for WH2, its corresponding update patch has included major, game-changing reworks for pre-existing races that are available to all players. Some examples of these are:

•	For the prophet and Warlock DLC, the underempire mechanic was added for the Skaven, allowing them to establish secret undercities in rival factions’ settlements. This mechanic drastically strengthened the race and made them much more viable in the campaign.

•	For the Vampire Coast DLC, the bloodlines mechanic was added to the Vampire Counts, which gave players the ability to customize their faction by using a unique resource called bloodkisses (gained by killing enemy heroes and faction leaders) to recruit lords from 5 different specializations that granted powerful faction-wide bonuses.

•	For the Shadow and Blade DLC, CA made numerous optimization improvements to the game that collectively reduced the end-turn times for all players by as much as 60%, addressing one of the biggest complaints (especially for ME campaign players) with the game. 

The one caveat here is that most of these community-wide improvements have only benefited those who own both games and thus have access to both the WH1 and WH2 races. However, thanks to how much content is unlocked by owning both and how cheaply WH1 can be bought on sale (as low as $5 now), practically everyone still active in the community does. So in effect CA is using DLC sales to subsidize the cost for improvements to the game that benefit (almost) the entire community. Because of this, everyone now gets excited for DLC releases, even those that don’t intend to buy them. 

And this is all for a game that’s now nearly 2 and a half years old, in which time CA has released 2 games, including its fastest-selling TW game ever. I think this is a fantastic way to handle DLC releases and I really hope it catches on.",Why I think Total War:Warhammer 2 offers a great example of DLC done right
Games,"My GPU busted a little over a year ago, so I essentially lost access to 90% of my library. Recently I wanted to play Skyrim again, and I'm considering either the Nintendo Switch Version or the Ps4 Pro. Seeing how the former is currently on sale for 29,99€ on the Nintendo E-shop, both versions are somewhat equal in terms of price. 

Perfomance-wise I thought that it should be a No-Brainer to go with the Ps4 Version, but then I remembered the complete trainwreck that was the Ps3 Version, a Slideshow that only grew  worse everytime your safe file grew, and that got me worried. And sure enough: To my knowledge Skyrim actually runs worse on the Ps4 **Pro** than on the regular playstation, because it runs at 4k. I can live with some framedrops now and then, but if it ever goes consistently below 30 or even 25, I'm out. Anyone one here with a lot of playtime on a Ps4 Pro who can tell me how bad it really gets?


The same goes for the Switch. Portable Skyrim sounds pretty great and from what Ive heard from some Youtubers the game itself runs rather smooth. I don't mind that its not Full HD, as long as it runs smooth. I should also mention that Mods are not really a factor.

I apologize for my English and rather you miss this post ... I had an idea for the game. Which could be a series.

This is the story of a dreamer. He came to the city with dreams and hopes. But the reality is cruel. When he found the important things for themselves. Sometimes this incident on the excavations. The plot is tied to the main character and his friends.Changes will check on the city where it all happens.

 At the beginning of our history, this guy arrives in the city of his dreams. And he thinks it's the best thing that has happened in his life. And so it is. Friends,girlfriend. the work of which he dreamed. But not all so simple. And everything in this life has a price.

During excavations in the castle, we find a strange room with a mirror. The first who discovered her, we will also be ourselves. In this room there will be a small collapse after which we will go to the hospital. This is the point where the light changes in history.

(

I just did not write that we left the house in search of adventure and to escape from the circumstances. This event also made us stay in the city where we ran away. But earlier we had to return home.

)

&amp;#x200B;

If you are beginning to envy him. That you're wasting it. Not all so rosy as it seems. The trip was also not accepted by all. And when our heroes have to because of some events back home and what happens is that our world has turned.

To be engaged in favorite business well. But our world is cruel. Yes, and to explore what was studied the length and breadth not rewarding business. But ... By coincidence of luck. Or rather, on the fatal failure of our hero finds an unexplored corner in the citadel. This is the beginning and the end point is not the return of our hero. They begin to happen strange things. Friends character change. The city is changing with them. Once paradise turns into a dry desert. And many do not pay attention to it. They think that it was, or should be. And because of this, our hero begins to suffer more and more getting into different situations with ""new"" friends.

But do not think that we will be unarmed all the time.  At key moments in the story, we will always find the right thing at hand.  Is it a coincidence? These moments are the starting point for the further significant development of the plot. These are moments of remembrance, and misunderstanding of why everything happens this way.  Also at these intervals, you can explore the available locations of the city to get some information.  There may also be skirmishes at these points. But they will no longer be so brightly perceived by our hero.

These moments are the point of departure for the further significant development of the plot. These are moments of remembrance, and misunderstanding of why everything happens this way. Also at these intervals we explore the city. We observe changes. And notice that ... Does it have to be like this?  The light should not go out, Where did those people go? they were just there. They will no longer be so brightly perceived by our hero.

Well, I’ll reveal something else from the plot ...

Question. That is, they forgot or did not notice the murdered? Answer. This is the disappearance of a person both from memory and from all places of photographs and other things.

And here again, the display plays a major role. In the beginning, the whole world plays with colors. Then it’s more noir. Paints are dark with some shades. The main plot references.

Question. Where people disappear. Answer. During the events with ""friends"" not one civilian was injured.

📷

The Room

Although the main events will occur in the citadel. We will spend time in the city where there will be plot twists. Loss of memory of friends and referrals to friends. Each person took a place in the life of our hero. Both people and objects will show changes.

As you can see in my first screenshot. In the corridor between air and earth. The corridor will pass.

It will be a battle between our hero and Max. In the dark corridor I saw him. I tried to shout him and ran to him. He stood with his back to me. When he turned, an incomprehensible force threw me back. On the edge of the corridor, streaks of fire began to sprout. My friend has become different. He was enveloped in an aura of fire. When I tried to turn to him again, the corridor shuddered and began to crumble after the cry of a friend.

Yes, I also wanted to tie all the moments tied to the elements. Associate with the harmony of the elements and their resonance.

Start at the end. We began our story when we found a strange room with a mirror. The mirror does not just play a major role. And here will be the last battle in the hall. A dramatic battle with the girl we love .

The girl worked in a flower shop. This gave her the look in which she appeared before the hero. And how should each drama have to kill her by freeing herself from the curse?

On this our sad story probably could have ended. After all, usually. When all battles are completed the story ends. But. Our hero saw a reflection in the mirror that attracted his attention.

We are upset by the loss of friends. Our hero sees his reflection in the mirror. And our reflection begins to separate from the mirror and leaves it. Our mirror double asks the hero. Who is to blame for everything? Can everything be fixed? Or maybe they are all alive ...? he says grinning. Events related to friends appear in memory. The hero, while remembering, is even more desperate. And blames himself. He says how they can be alive if he killed them all. And events with the fight against ""friends"" appear. Mirroring double interrupting our hero says that everything can be fixed.

The hero turns his eyes to the double who begins to disappear before his eyes. The hero, not understanding what is happening, begins to try to grab hold of the smoke from the mirror clone with his hands. Now the speech of the double is filling the whole hall. The main essence of speech. Is he ready to sacrifice his life for his friends. The hero claims to be ready for anything. And the clone from the mirror appears again with a smile on his face. In his hands he grips the hero's torn heart. The hero in these fractions of seconds tries to shout NO! He does not understand what happened. We hear the sounds of the heartbeat begin to fall silent ...

Well, all the movie guys ended the credits light went out. And you go and eat the popcorn back. Is it just that? We hear that ...

There was a sound that the heart began to beat again. But i can’t add it

I'm trying to find work to leave the concentration camp. So I come up with different stories in the hope that I will be lucky. Somehow I can get out of the bloody concentration camp from the terrorists that they are killing us here. The financial pyramid just sucks us to the last drop of blood. Terrorism is the same disease as cancer or another deadly disease. I just offer my ideas. In the hope that suddenly it will be possible to remove the series from this. And it will bring me money. I can get out of the concentration camp. I will have food, a house, medical assistance will be provided ... Maybe sometime I will learn to drive a car. I can live a normal life. Which you can only dream of in a concentration camp ... Where you can not speak against terrorists and words.

Ready to learn. To the best of their abilities. I just do not want to be in a concentration camp with terrorists. I’m scared that they even learn that I said something against them, because this persecution continues. And they can kill anyone who is against corruption. Who is telling the truth. They just brainwash everyone using people as they please. That terrorism, that coronavirus is a disease that must be eradicated.

 I just want to find a job related to games. I'm trying to find a way to evacuate from a concentration camp. I honestly don’t know how to escape from this terrible place. I thought to apply for i589, but this must be checked out first. And I don’t even know how to submit this form from the concentration camp. All examples are only when you are in America. I do not want to live in the world of the financial pyramid of terrorists. There is no future in it. No life. Even a family cannot be created and maintained.

Games,"Another Redditor reminded me of my first go 'round with the Mass Effect Trilogy.

I remember the hype revolving around that game even before the first one released. And how the first Mass Effect lived up to the hype and the sequel surpassed it. 

The story telling was amazing. And for the record, it pretty much was all the way through until the very end. The professional game journalists, critics and game makers never REALLY understood why the fans were so angry with the original ending. ( Not that the improved ending was really much better.)

If you played Mass Effect years later. You might not understand either. So, I'll explain.

Even before Mass Effect released, game journalists were raving about this game. The game makers talked about how every choice you made would have an impact on the story now and then, much later. Each and every choice could come back to haunt you, even in the final game of the trilogy. 

Mass Effect released, you had a huge world, with a lot of story and a lot of side missions. And, the game lived up to the hype. The game play was good, the story great. And every choice you made had consequences as promised. 

Mass Effect 2 releases 3 years later. Fan hype is high, journalist hype is high. The game exceeds most people's expectations. There are tons of characters, DLC content is actually fulfilling. The characters all have depth, their own stories and the end of this game has SERIOUS consequences.

After the first game and up until the release of the third in the trilogy, fans began to speculate on each story every side mission, how could it effect things going forward? What impact would it have on the final game?

Fans had multiple saves for all the different endings. The game makers kept reaffirming, all these choices would have an impact. 

Then the third game released. And while the game play was solid, and the story was good, the ending felt, empty. It turned out that the original ending of the trilogy was the same, unless you count the color of a light that went through the relays. 

Later, the game makers added a clip that showed some.of the surviving characters. This did almost nothing.

I can't speak for every fan. But I believe most of them were upset for the same reason I was. Apart from one or two characters, the fate of the others are never really shown. So your choice at the end and it's impact is left to your imagination. And it turns out that whatever you decided in the previous two games, had no impact on the third, unless a character died in the others and then, they simply weren't there.

In the end your alliances had no impact on the end of the game. Whoever was going to live or die, would love be or die anyway. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen anyway. And, these characters you had spent 3 games with, years with, speculating their date, investing in them, you were left wanting. 

Game journalists defended the ending, and only understood half the reason why fans were upset. Game makers too. 

If play through it now, not hearing any of the hype, not left to wait, wonder and imagine what could be, the anger would be lost on you. 

I'm not angry anymore, I wasn't really, I was just disappointed. I think if the game was remastered I would enjoy it a lot. And none of that past disappointment would return. I mean, I wouldn't expect more than it could deliver.",The Mass Effect Trilogy

Games,"PvP Rant about shooters

Let me preface this by saying, i’ve been gaming since i was little and i like to think i’m above average in skill across a ton of games.  Not a pro or anything, but i’ve managed to get in high ranks on any game i play. I know everyone plays different etc.


Lately these pst few years i’ve started noticing that games rely on nothing but the cheapest wins, metas, camping or overall just boring ways of winning. It’s getting to the point that i’ve gradually stopped playing multiplayer games simply because nobody enjoys actual competition or fun. 
It’s their game and they can play how they want, i understand that, but when every match i join (whether it be Call of Duty, Destiny, Overwatch, PUBG or etc) is only full of the most broken guns/characters and setups possible, it tends to get really frustrating. 


Camping, it seems you can’t play any shooter without every lobby having half the teams in corners. It’s easy to come back and kill them, but that is no challenge at all, might as well go up against bots at that point. The matches just end up feeling empty when only 4 players are running around when there’s 12 per lobby.


Metas, i understand metas help you win in comp/ranked matches, but if you are only going to play to win or cheese through competition, then why not just go play against bots or story mode? I personally pick characters i enjoy and get good with them whether they are the weakest or the strongest. I take my time to get good with what i have and hold my weight sometimes even carry with off-meta setups. It makes the game fun because i don’t rely on cheap weapons or buffs to help me start winning. 


Matchmaking, it really ruins my day when i get thrown into a match where my entire team is scattered and randoms vs clans or people that only stick in big groups. It’s smart i’m not gonna say it’s not, but it really just reinforces cheap ways to win if only one side is running in a hive mind group and i’m alone trying my best to beat them. 


All in all, i just wanted to say that games aren’t what they used to be, nobody plays for fun or skill anymore like they used to. It’s all about cheap wins, skins and K/D. 

I would love to enjoy a good game where every is just playing the challenge and everything is actually balanced.

Games,"This game is still kicking and I'm tempted by it. But I have a number of worries about trying to jump into it. This is mostly caused by the fact that I'm not really interested in the story mode and my exposure to the game is based on watching youtubers play the game.

1. How is the grind? This is something that youtubers never show. They either skip it because it's boring or they buy their way through the game. Neither of which I can do. So while the game may look fun for them, is that fun gated behind a whole lot of grinding that I'd need to do?

1. Does the game perform badly? This IS something that youtubers lament about. The long load times and sketchy server connection in particular. But again, whenever it gets bad they would snip the recording and be back in the thick of it in seconds; not something you can do in reality.
1. Is there a big gap presented to new players? Youtubers tend to play on their own private servers were there is no random people around to disrupt them. But would I find my play sessions impeded by people in high level tanks griefing in any way they can? I think the game has a passive mode but I'm unsure how that works and even without killing me the experience would be dampened. This question would be more relevant in other games where experience directly related to how powerful your character is but the question remains, would I stand a chance? Would I need to?
1. I've heard rumours of rampant hacking but perhaps that is a case of the squeaky wheel getting the grease. They exist in a lot of games but how often do you actually find them?
1. How necessary is it to have friends to play the game? I feel I'm unlikely to actually be able to pull any friends in which means it'd be up to me to *shudder* make some new ones. I did a quick google for discord servers in OCE but couldn't find any. Is there a working pick up group system somewhere? Do you need one?",GTA5:Online in 2020

Games,"People wanting ""more of Doom 2016"" are going to be disappointed.

It's still Doom, but is more campy than the previous game.

In a weird way, it's more like classic Doom in this regard.

However, so far, for every step forward, it takes a step back, but the steps back are smaller.

For starters, it's far more colorful and saturated. The environments are extremely detailed and interesting. There are some very cool visuals.

There  are also a lot more invisible walls. In an that looked like a destroyed shopping center, I couldn't jump behind a counter because of an invisible wall. I also fell a few times looking for secrets by trying  to jump to a ledge where it looked like I could land, only to hit an invisible wall and fall.

Falling doesn't outright kill you anymore. You just spawn back on the ground minus a bit of health.

The  soundtrack isn't as good this time so far. It's not bad though. It's industrial metal again, but I'm finding it less interesting. It just doesn't have the same kick to it as the last game.

It's also a lot more cartoonish than Doom 2016. Enemies look less ""real"". They seem to have a little of that ""rubbery"" effect animation has sometimes.

The environments are really nice, but also seem less grounded somehow.

The enemies animate really well, the kills are inventive so far, and it's definitely entertaining.

Ammo,  armor, health, and powerups pickups are also a lot more cartoonish. They glow neon colors, more so than in Doom 2016. They are larger and look a bit  out of place to be honest. They are easy to see though, which isn't a  bad thing.

There are also secrets, but rather than being objects placed in the world like the little Funpop Doom guys from Doom 2016, they are large question marks.

The first keycard I found was just floating in the air in an empty  room. In Doom 2016 you found them on bodies and they were naturally  placed in the environment. They seem to care less about that this time.

There's also a 1-up powerup that kicks in when you die. It resurrects you and slows down time for a brief period. It's a large green Doom Guy helmet that says 1-up.

Gameplay is fast, and you're dropped right into things. I have no idea what is going on aside from ""Hell on Earth"". It does not pick up where Doom 2016 left off, unless there's some backtracking in the story later.

I'm thinking there may be some explanation for it, but I'm not sure if it's going to be in codex entries or be a plot point in the actual game.

It also seems harder.

You have a lot less ammo, need to be more accurate, and can't just glory kill unarmed zombies anymore. They aren't just walking health and armor packs anymore. They take a lot more damage and need to be shot first.  

You need to be accurate with your shots, at least in the first area. I'm thinking the game will allow you to upgrade your ammo at some point, but you start out with only 16 shotgun shells.

I've encountered fairly large groups of enemies in the first area, a lot more than in Doom 2016's early areas, but not as many as in some of the later areas.

You'll encounter some fairly bullet spongey enemies early on as well.

Traversal seems to be a bigger focus this time, with bars that swing you around, and I've encountered a fair number of jump pads. Stuff seems less naturally placed though.

It's still a blast to play, but may not be what people are expecting it to be.

A  lot of people are going to hate this game, but I've enjoyed it so far.  I'm unsure if I'll come out of it thinking it is as good as Doom 2016  though.

I'll definitely be  finishing it at least. It's fun and new Doom. Though, again, it seems to  be more of a throwback to classic Doom in some ways, and not always in  ways that improve on Doom 2016.",Doom Eternal is not what I was expecting. No Spoilers. First impression.

Games,"I'm prefacing by saying I haven't played it yet and am going of what others have said and this post is mostly to let people know that the original game is not the same as Royal because I have seen lot's of people everywhere saying that it's just a cashgrab that should have been in the original game.

I'll start by saying that if you never played Persona 5 you should go play Royal right now and avoid the rest of my post, the game in its original form was amazing but with Royal it may just be one of the greatest of all time. If you're worried that the story is changed by a lot compared to the original don't be, the main storyline doesn't have major changes besides combat and mechanical stuff. Also if you're worried that you won't like it because it's a JRPG then I wouldn't be that worried about it, I'm not that into JRPG's in general but Persona 5 and Persona in general is different.

In terms of changes, you don't have a reworked combat system by any means but you have some amazing improvements. With Persona's you have Persona traits, they are simply put different traits that give each Persona a special ability that could change how you would normally play with the Persona.

The other big combat change is with Baton passes, they are a lot different now. Firstly you have stages with Baton passes, with every stage the person you passed the Baton too will gain hp and sp(I may be wrong about sp tho) and if you get stage 3 the person can do any move without using any sp or hp cost. There are also ranks, these are earned by playing darts in the new area they added, 3 ranks in total and they give different boosts at every rank which quite amazing.

Also my personal favorite change in the combat is the Showtime graphics which are amazing, even better than the All Out attack ones.

Minor changes with combat is that lots of Personas have been re-balanced and you restock with ammo automatically.

You also have reworked Palaces, and I mean reworked. They are very different at certain points and at some points are completely different. Lots of the bosses are different especially Madrame who has a brand new stage, there are new stuff to do while in the palaces such as collecting Will Seeds and using a bloody grappling hook. They are very different, I don't want to spoil much but they are very different from the original.

The biggest changes are to Mementos, you have a lot new stuff in Mementos that make them much better which is really good because that was probably the worst part in the game. You have a new NPC that can be used to upgrade stuff like money earned, exp earned and etc and you also lots of QOL of life changes, once again not going into much detail here because it could get quite spoilery.

The stuff above is just some major changes but there is a lot more I didn't add, but that's not all because there is lots of NEW content. You have two new confidants, one with a new Phantom Thieves member, you have a brand new area which is really damn good and you get a brand new semester along with a new palace which adds roughly 30 more hours of content.

That's all the major stuff added and reworked but I think it's worth mentioning that there is also worked on the base story quite a bit and reworked lots of major plot holes that existed and added some new scenes and arcs to the base game, they also reworked almost all the confidants as well.

Hopefully that wall text was enough to convince someone who was on fence about the game because they were worried that it's too similar to the original.

Oh and one more thing that little shit Morgana doesn't tell you to sleep anymore so that alone should be worth price of admission.","Despite all the pretty big releases this past month, Persona 5: Royal looks to be the best"

Games,"I've seen a bunch of different threads talk about issues regarding the remake (I've made a bunch myself that got quite popular). However, one I feel has been misunderstood time and time again by both people on this site, and also reviewers on YouTube, has been the criticism that what was released wasn't a complete game, therefore people will wait/not buy the game.

Since release a lot of reviewers and commenters have made the point that this is an ""idiotic"" statement because the game is 40 hours long (approximately), therefore the game is complete and if you say otherwise you're just stupid/entitled/or whinging.

I've made this argument before a few months before release, and now since the release so I feel compelled to hone in on this and defend the point I and so many others have made.

I may just be speaking for myself, but I do not care how long the game is. It could be 4, 40, or 400 hours and I still wouldn't care as the game that was Final Fantasy 7 is still incomplete. 

To compare it to another medium, it would be as if George Lucas (or rather Disney as it is right now) released a remake of the original Star Wars, but only up to the scene where they leave Mos Eisley. They could pad that shit out with so much filler about how Luke wrangled the villagers cats back together before leaving, how long the trip was to get there, him digging the grave for Uncle Owen, but the fact of the matter stands that ""Star Wars"" begins with Luke on a farmstead and ends with him blowing up the Death Star. To promise only around 1/5 of that and sell it as a remake wouldn't fly.

We can make this comparison to any medium, would a reprint of ""Flowers for Algernon"" be called complete if only 1/3 was released now for the same price as the full novel was in its original printing?

My argument, and many others from what I've seen, isn't that the game is too short. It's that the game is incomplete from a story standpoint. Final Fantasy 7 was never a trilogy, it was a complete game sold as such. The argument that the ""game is too big for the PS4"" also doesn't fly when you consider that:

 A) The story shouldn't come at the expense of graphical fidelity, or filler that is taking space that would otherwise be allocated to the story. No matter how small that may be. 

B) The Witcher 3 also exists with all its expansions so please tell me how a game that gorgeous and expansive can run but not a remake of a 23 year old game.

Again, this is nothing to do with the length of the game, but from what I've seen and read in reviews there is a lot of monotony added to sections that previously had none or comparatively less, back tracking through entire sections along with the same enemies and bosses (the sewers section apparently has this), and the side quests are in large part superfluous and ""busy work"" to act as filler content.

For me, if the choice was to have that, or the complete story of FF7 as it was sold in the original game, then I know where I would be spending my money.

So that's it really, my main point is that contrary to reviews and other commenter, no this isn't about ""value for money"" in terms of hours spent to money spent, this isn't about ""it's still 40 hours"". This is about the quality of that time, if I'm to spend 40 hours of my time in a game I'd rather it be spent on a full complete story as it was in the original FF7 or any number of recent RPG's like Persona 5, rather than spend it on what is effectively 1/5 the complete story and a bunch of filler content that seems to be reviewed mixed at best.",A defense of one criticism leveled at Final Fantasy 7 Remake that I feel is misunderstood.

Strategy lovers welcome to the guide with Cheats and Hack on how to win at Legends of Runeterra, the new card game from Riot Games. The game's open beta started on January 24, but making its way into ranked matches is not a simple thing.

So let's see a series of strategies to be put in place before starting to play seriously, in order to always ensure your victory.

[Legends of Runeterra: Cheats and strategies to know.](https://leastuces.com/2020/04/23/cheats-legends-of-runeterra/)  


If you are a fan of card video games or simply the world of LoL, Legends of Runeterra (LoR) is definitely a game that will meet your expectations. The title of Riot in fact fishes in full hands from other great titles in the sector (Magic, Hearthstone, Gwent etc.) but manages to add mechanics to the gameplay that make the games intense and fun to play.

Like any self-respecting card title, however, it has foundations or, if you like, internal strategies that must be known first of all to learn how to play but also, and above all, to farm and get cards without spending real money. So here are our tricks to better face the game:

Apart from the basic one that introduces the initial phase, LoR has a section of 13 total tutorials (in the Play menu) where you can learn the strategies of each type of deck, discover its strengths and weaknesses, as well as unlock a good part of the Champions and cards of each faction.

Before proceeding to any other section of the game, therefore, it is advisable to complete each available tutorial that will also allow you to obtain different experience points to level up and unlock new rewards, also enhancing the weekly chests.

If you happen to dive to the bottom of a body of water, or look behind a certain boulder, or peer into a murky log in the swamp, or even spot an optical illusion cast by a cave wall and explore it, you will be rewarded by the personal touch that the developers put into all of those respective environments, so that your thoroughness truly means something.

By none of the other Elder Scrolls games have I been so enthralled. Although the game is a bit dated, its infinite charm supersedes its clunkiness—at least for me. It’s a great Elder Scrolls game that I find new modicums of detail in even to this day.

## Introduction

This study covers 23,630 games for 21 systems and 8 metrics of information: release date, system released on, critical metascore, genre(s), length of time to beat the main story, length of time to complete everything, ESRB ratings, and ESRB content descriptors. These games were all released in North America between the second quarter of 1995 and the third quarter of 2019. The selection of games is not comprehensive of anything, it is a sample, and it is important to know how the games were chosen.

I started with games that had at least 5 critical reviews on GameRankings, a now-closed review aggregator which was similar to Metacritic, but had some great sorting options. I chose GameRankings over Metacritic  because of those sorting options and because it included older games. Although it had 4th generation games it was mostly the greatest hits of the era, so I started with 5th generation games. I included all systems from the ""Big Four"" (Nintendo, Sony, Sega, Microsoft) and the PC from the 5th generation to the current 8th generation. I also chose to start at the 5th generation because the ESRB didn't start rating games until partway through the 4th generation and this way all the games included could potentially have data for each metric. For some systems I included the full list of games from wikipedia. For example, I included all 3DS games because only about 40% of its library has a metascore. For PC games I instead needed a way to cut down the number of titles, so every PC game with a GameRankings metascore was included.

All games had to have a release date, this actually disqualified some older games with unknown dates. One issue I ran into was many PC games from 1995 to 1997 supposedly had release dates on the last day of the month, way too many to be a coincidence. Multiple sources listed the same release dates, but I wasn't able to find any information as to whether this was just when games were released at the time or if only the approximate release date is known and everyone decided to just round to the nearest last day of the month and offer no disclaimer that it is only an estimate.

All games had to have a genre. I'll go into more detail on this later, but my genres were from MobyGames, which had genres listed for almost every game. For some of the few games without genres listed, I did my best to guess how MobyGames would have assigned it.

For games that are released on multiple platforms each occurrence is counted as a separate game. Although they are usually almost identical, exceptions do exist, and review scores are often a bit different even when games perform the same on different platforms.

All non-PC games had to have an ESRB rating. PC games were excluded because quite a few PC games, even some big exclusives, don't have ratings. This was an issue with some obscure digital-only games, especially ones that had been removed from stores.

No expansion packs or DLC were included, unless they could be played without the base game.

So ultimately we have 23,630 games, all with release dates, genres, and systems. 17,192 have metascores, 12,652 have time to complete main story, 9,687 have completionist times, 22,651 have ESRB ratings and content descriptors.

This was a mammoth project, probably the largest I'll ever do at once, that took over 9 months. It is complete, but it is so large (over 100 images) that I will be posting it in several chunks while I work on other projects. It will be 5 parts total (plus some bonuses) going over each metric, and also the interesting combinations.

Here is how the games included number by year. Note that this is not meant to be fully proportional to how many games were actually released each year. Some of the by-year graphs will have big swings in the first few years, this is because there weren't many games included for those years.

## Metascores - General

First, let's look at metascores. I got all of my data from GameRankings a few months before it was shut down. While I'm saddened that this easy to use site was shut down, there are some archives if you want to see it: [The Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20191209170438/https://www.gamerankings.com/) has a full copy, there is an [archive](https://gr.blade.sk/#/) website created by someone named Matúš, and they also have a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wtV8yBr5RXAjO_1kakzFcHd7TKGw7pIUVNI5SYouCUM/edit#gid=782449831) of all the scores.

Usually when you hear about game metascores, it is Metacritic's metascore. GameRankings metascores were very similar, rarely ever more than 2 points different, but they included different review outlets. However, unlike Metacritic, they seem to use a straight average, rather than weighing some outlets more than others. They also give metascores with accuracy to the hundredths digit.

[https://i.imgur.com/YBTYnEf.png](https://i.imgur.com/YBTYnEf.png)

Let's start with the average metascore by year. A pretty steady increase in scores for over a decade. This may not be entirely about the quality of the games released, but rather have more to do with outlets reviewing fewer small digital-only titles, but this is speculation. One has to wonder what caused the 2006-2008 crater. [This video](https://youtu.be/RLzMl7pBLAE?t=2358) of a GDC talk by EEDAR blames the Wii alone for a dip in review scores in 2006 and 2007, but their data looks a bit different than mine. [This article about a reddit post ](https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/28/7083373/look-at-this-chart-of-average-metacritic-scores-what-happened-in-2007)focuses on 2007 and theorizes about the Wii, but also budget PS2 and DS games.

[https://i.imgur.com/BcVnNSP.png](https://i.imgur.com/BcVnNSP.png)

But maybe you want to argue about which system has the best games. Here we have the averages, worst rated, and best rated game for Nintendo systems. For the mode on all of these metascores I rounded the scores to the nearest whole number, otherwise you end up with the mode occuring 2 or 3 times and not having much to do with the typical game. The Wii and DS do have the lowest averages, giving some weight to them dragging down the overall average. The Wii U did better than you might expect, although there's plenty of RCMADIAX games that weren't included. The Switch comes out on top, a real crowd pleaser despite a glut of shovelware.

[https://i.imgur.com/wH7xDM1.png](https://i.imgur.com/wH7xDM1.png)

You're probably shocked that the Sega Saturn has the highest GameRankings metascore. It's worth an asterisk because it has the same problem as systems from the previous generation: only the cream of the crop were included. GameRankings launched in 1999, the same year as the Dreamcast was released, so they would have had to go through old magazines and website reviews to record scores, and they must have prioritized the most popular games, moreso than the N64 or PS1. In fact, there are about one ninth as many Saturn game reviews as N64. A contributing factor may also be that publications just weren't interested in reviewing the more average Saturn games, due to its low sales in North America.

[https://i.imgur.com/e5f9E8d.png](https://i.imgur.com/e5f9E8d.png)

Here's all that system data in a nice chart, including the overall. A lot of Rockstar games topping the system bests. I find it interesting how many of the worst games aren't even famous for being bad, they were just quietly forgotten. But who could forget the classic Metal Gear Solid? For Game Boy Color. We can also see that the best selling console or handheld never has the highest average score compared to its competition.

[https://i.imgur.com/EVgxEde.png](https://i.imgur.com/EVgxEde.png)

Let's go deeper, here's every Nintendo system's average metascore by quarter. Something to note is that some quarters, especially the first and the last several, only have 1-4 games, causing some large swings. That last Wii U quarter is less impressive when you consider it was solely Breath of the Wild.

There were also a few quarters with no scored games in between quarters that did have them. Lines have been connected in between data points. That said, the general trend seems to be upward, especially with the 3DS.

[https://i.imgur.com/FGB6HWp.png](https://i.imgur.com/FGB6HWp.png)

The PS1 has the distinction of the worst quarter ever. The only game with a GameRankings metascore for that quarter was Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22 which got a 32.03. I apologize but in finding out that tidbit of information I see that I did not include Q2 2003 for the PS1. Three games from that period average 67.68.  These charts are fairly good at showing how system's life spans overlap, quite a few years had three Sony systems coming out with new games worth reviewing, 2014 even had four!

[https://i.imgur.com/2G2WuAD.png](https://i.imgur.com/2G2WuAD.png)

The short life of the Saturn and Dreamcast can be seen here. Xbox consoles seem to have a shorter overlap than Playstation. Overall, these charts make it hard to point to any ""golden age"" for a system, ratings jump up and down all the time.

[https://i.imgur.com/3jFO9H0.png](https://i.imgur.com/3jFO9H0.png)

In case you don't like all of those lines, here's the full chart, with the PS1 correction. There were quite a few gaps late in the PSP's life.

[https://i.imgur.com/KivMRbN.png](https://i.imgur.com/KivMRbN.png)

People often refer to a lack of games and a lack good games during the first part of the year. And during the summer. Here I took every game with a metascore and changed the release year to 2000 to find when the best and worst games are released throughout the year. Daily scores are all over the place, there's not much to glean from them. 12/28 is the highest, but only 4 metascored games were released that day.

Weekly averages have more of a story to tell but still have some odd peaks and valleys. Monthly averages show a gradual rise and fall, but only vary by about 3 percent.

[https://i.imgur.com/uYF0tsM.png](https://i.imgur.com/uYF0tsM.png)

The raw numbers show August, September, and October as the critical highlight of the year, quickly followed by the December and January low points. Despite August's strong performance, it has the weakest day of the whole year on the 4th. The highest rated months also seem to have daily values that are less variable.

## Metascores - Specifics

[https://i.imgur.com/nsV8vl1.png](https://i.imgur.com/nsV8vl1.png)

Sure, 70.25 might be the overall average metascore, but how are those distributed? While scores have crept up over the years, 90+s have consistently stayed under 5%. On the other end of the scale games scoring under 60% aren't a whole lot more common.

[https://i.imgur.com/gzy3jbw.png](https://i.imgur.com/gzy3jbw.png)

Percentiles are the value needed to be in the top x% percent(ile). So if you get a 95% on a test in a class of 100 students, and only one person scored better than you, you would be in the 99th percentile and the value of the 99th percentile is a score of 95. The 100th percentile is the highest score, and the 0th percentile is the lowest.

I should have reversed the order of the legend, oops. Just over an 85% metascore will put a game among the 10% highest rated. The gaps between percentiles get larger the lower you go, but overall they are pretty evenly spaced among their small range.

[https://i.imgur.com/I82pg4Z.png](https://i.imgur.com/I82pg4Z.png)

The standard deviation is a measure of how much values disperse (deviate) compared the average (standard). A low standard deviation means values are mostly close together, of which game metascores are an example, and they have become closer for several straight years.

[https://i.imgur.com/cCF0ens.png](https://i.imgur.com/cCF0ens.png)

You really like numbers if you look through this chart detailing the last three graphs.

## Metascores - 90+

[https://i.imgur.com/GAPzlE9.png](https://i.imgur.com/GAPzlE9.png)

Games that score at least a 90 can be considered the very best games with cross-genre appeal that are part of the conversation about the best games of all time, classics that are discussed for many years. The number of 90+ games doesn't follow average review scores too closely, although 2006 is still a bad year. Keep in mind I have few games from 1995-1997, I know a lot of great stuff came out then, this is not percent based at all. Even with average review scores creeping upward, the number of 90+ games has generally gone down. Do you think 2003 really had a classic coming out more than every other week on average?

[https://i.imgur.com/SSKC5rP.png](https://i.imgur.com/SSKC5rP.png)

Keep in mind that pre-1999 games were more likely to be included if they were the best and most famous games. 2006 is again a low point, but we can see 2011 being a turning point as well. My cutoff was before the likely highest scoring time of year for 2019, so it probably wouldn't be as low as shown here if I included all of it.

[https://i.imgur.com/wUX29uH.png](https://i.imgur.com/wUX29uH.png)

But enough about percentages, maybe you just want to buy the system with the most high quality games available. Well, you can't go wrong the system that has been around the longest, the PC. But to put that into perspective, if we consider the average system's lifespan to be 6 years, then the PC has been around for 4 and one sixth system lifespans (for the purposes of this 25 year study). If we divide that 97 by 4 and one sixth, we get an average of 23.28 per system lifespan, pretty close to the Gamecube. At 5 year lifespans, 19.4.

The massive libraries of the PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360 help them achieve top status if we disregard the PC. Other than the exceptionally successful PS2 the numbers remain pretty close between Sony and Microsoft when comparing competing consoles. The Dreamcast had quite a few in its short lifetime.

That's all for metascores, next up is genres. I won't be posting that part to reddit, so check out [SpriteCell](https://SpriteCell.com) to follow the project.

Games,"I'm working on a research project about the best settings/worlds/universes bloomed within the videogame medium.    
  
Of course, aestethics is not everything: there are several reasons why a game might be considered one to have the best setting.  
Maybe it's a rich and detailed world, maybe it has a masterful level design, maybe the secret lies in the ""lore"" of the game, or maybe it's a combination of all these factors and others.  
  
For example, the wild west from Red Dead Redemption 2 might easily be considered one of the best videogame worlds due to landscapes, NPC routines, dynamic weather and every detail that favors immersion.  
  
At the same time, we could say that Space Station Transtar Talos I from Prey could be even better while sporting less appealing aesthetics, because it has an incredibile level design and the way you interact with the world is very impatcful.  
  
And someone else could argue that Azeroth from World of Warcraft is better than both the aforementioned two, because it tells a story through its inhabitants and has tons of interesting lore to discover.  
  
What are your thoughts? What are in your opinion the best videogame worlds and why?","What are, in your opinion, the best video game worlds out there?"
Games,"So I recently completed A Plague Tale: Innocence and while it being an amazing game for it’s story and narrative, I couldn’t help but think I wish the antagonist was portrayed a more believable character and not the typical evil snickering squinting type you see all the time. 

So what games can you think of where the antagonist is actually someone believable, maybe even to the point of expressing sympathy towards them?

Edit: I think people mentioning Vaas from Far Cry 3 are totally missing the point of this thread. Yes he is a great villain but he’s far from a realistic I-can-understand-his-pain/motives type of antagonist I’m asking for. He’s evil incarnate and the definition of a comical villain.",What games do you know of that in which the antagonist/villain is very believable and aren’t the typical comical type of villains you see in almost everything?
Games,"I just finished watching [this video](https://youtu.be/izxXGuVL21o) on the behind the scenes of Crash Bandicoot. As a non programmer, I found it pretty interesting to watch and it got me thinking: the 'behind the scenes' of game development doesn't get discussed much here. 

What are some example of creative programming or general outside the box solutions developers have made over the years to get a game to run?

Expand a little further, what are some examples of a games code leading to some seemingly bizarre bugs and how were they ultimately resolved? 

Or just general programming anecdotes talk is fine too. I'm reminded of the [general mess that was Gen I of Pokemon.](https://memeworld.funnyjunk.com/pictures/Problems+with+gen+1+not+oc+just+interesting+read_cad9bb_3856475.jpg) and how Iwata apparently saved the day optimising Gen 2.",What are you favourite examples of creative programming or weird bugs in games?
Games,"Playing through Bioshock Infinite again I got the item that gives you temporary invulnerability every time you heal (either by medkits or eating food) and I had to stop using it because I found I could chain healing &gt; murdering while invulnerable &gt; looting a barrel during combat (which pauses combat) &gt; eating food I find &gt; murder while invulnerable to the point that it killed my enjoyment of the game, so opted to not use it. 

Do you have any similiar experiences? I don't think things like the Infinite Rocket Launcher in RE4 count because it's a reward for a challenge that requires multiple playthroughs, but something that you use on your first run through without too much fuckery to get it. 

A lesser but not so egregious example would be the Drake Sword from the OG dark souls. When I do a subsequent playthrough I usually skip it because it just makes the early to mid/late game a big joke, but you do have to either cheese the Drake with a bow or bullrush the tail and hope you don't get blow the hell up.",Have you ever opted to *not* use a tool/weapon/skill in a game because it made it too easy?
Games,"its well known that people will often play games in ways that are less fun but more effecient. but i dont get why. i mean if not for fun why are you even playing the game

i would love to just play age of empires as a city builder and trade and fight with other cities/civs  
but instead people study hours for build orders and do the math for every single food per minute that might increase the chance of winning by 0.001%... but why would you do that if its less fun.

&amp;#x200B;

this is a genuine question by the way not a rant. im curious not mad because im bad at certain games.",why do people play in ways that make them more likely to win and not in ways that are the most fun?
Games," I analyzed all Metacritic scores of all games to see how often users and critics agree with each other. Since this sub doesn't allow image post, here is the link to my r/gaming post with the summary plots:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/hcprl4/analysis\_of\_games\_metacritic\_scores/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/hcprl4/analysis_of_games_metacritic_scores/) 

For the top left plot, each dot represents a Metacritic entry. All platforms are included, and the same game on different platforms are treated as separate data points. Data points on the orange line are when critic scores and user scores are equal. Users and critics only agree with each other 783 out of 16220 times.

The plot on the right shows that the disagreement between critics and users stay relatively constant (year 2000-present). The all-time average difference between user and critic score is 0.9 ± 0.01. This difference is significant because 1 point separates lousy games from average games and good games from great games. There is not a lot of data before the year 2000 hence the error bar (Metacritic launch in 1999). Note, 2020 is not over yet also.

For the bottom graph, I compared the average score of PlayStation, Xbox, and PC games. Despite of the Console Wars, gaming platforms do not dictate our enjoyment of games. We all can bond over the fact that most games we paid for are mediocre.

Games,"Hi r/Games

**We're Rob &amp; Kat**, a gaming couple who got the crazy idea to develop our very own game some years back when circumstances in our current jobs changed. Rob has a background coding for several backend systems in some major telecom &amp; financial companies, while Kat is a digital fantasy artist and a game graphics designer contracting several years for Arcen Games.

**We started developing SAMA in 2016** with the main idea being we wanted a digging-based, fun, little puzzle game taking inspiration from classics we used to love playing, such as Boulderdash and Dig dug. We had more recently also discovered and played Spelunky, Terraria and Steamworld dig, and these games all combined some elements (action, slight crafting, puzzle elements) we wanted to combine in our game.

**Need less to say that SAMA developed into a much bigger project than we first anticipated**, from a ""we'll have this ready in about 6 months"" to almost 4 years later :) It started as ""we'll do one level that you dig your way through and solve puzzles along the way"", to ""let's have a whole story about several planets being mined and you need to get your way through them all with lots more things to find, monsters to fight, different environments to battle through and loads of puzzles to solve"".

**We are currently in the Steam Game Festival** where you can check out our game with a free demo, and live streams with Bumpy McSquigums every night from 7PM ET.

&gt;Marvel's Iron Man VR is a perfect example of why VR exists and the possibilities of it. It is must-play for anyone who owns the device and an unforgettable and unique game.

&gt;Marvel's Iron Man VR provides some of the most enjoyable action-packed missions ever available in a virtual reality game. You may have to lollygag around for a while before being able to actually play these missions but they're definitely worth the wait.

**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Gabriel Bogdan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) - *German* - [7.8 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/marvels-iron-man-vr-review-zeit-zum-abheben/)

&gt;Marvel’s Iron Man VR delivers a solid experience for fans of the comics. With a bit more detailed areas and less frustating interactions the game could have been a lot better but besides that, the air combat gameplay is amazing and you'll see a lot of familiar faces from the Marvel Universe.

&gt;Move Controllers continue to age well-past their due date, but the game achieves its main goal. Iron Man VR makes you feel like a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist; you are Iron Man.

&gt;For every few moments in Iron Man VR that gave me an absolute rush, there were several that felt comfortably sterile. That's not the best ratio, but I'd definitely play more and I hope that Camouflaj gets their hands on Iron Man again: if only to see how they can top themselves and mend their mistakes.

Any of the old school remembers this 90s game for PC (can’t remember Win or DOS), in which you had to build a crew of soldiers to investigate strange phenomena and thug stuff going on between planets:
* you could rename them, pickup characters according to their abilities, they had different colors
* you could travel between planets in a spacecraft but you couldn’t drive the craft. You would just spawn in another world.
* the strange phenomena, I remember a planet where was this toxic pink substance all over the city and you had to investigate...
* nearly all of the time if not mistaken, you always played the game in aerial view

e.g. you beat the enemy under a certain time or get an S-rank rating and you automatically get everything and can move on to new challenges.

It'd probably be hard to balance so I'm curious if anyone has done it. Monster Hunter is kind of like this (but not an MMO) with part breaking as a challenge within the fight, and FFXI had Abyssea procs to unlock certain drops which were locked until you performed some actions, but it was still RNG at the end.",Do any MMOs with skill-based drops exist?

What really makes AC unique is precisely the fact that it is the only AAA series aside from military shooters that tries to have a semi accurate historical setting. 

What makes AC good is the historical part. Not the Sci /magic part. Its what they market their games toward. Let me know when Desmond or whoever the hell  is the animus now (who cares) shows up on the cover. They should have gotten rid of it entirely and pivoted totally towards realism. Go play God of War if you want magic.

What other historical games are these people complaining about? Computer RTSs? Kingdom come deliverance? I would love nothing more than a good AAA level game that takes place purely in the past that isnt a COD style shooter. No animus stuff, no hot girl in a white lab coat talking to me through my mind, just put me in a historical setting and let me explore.

I’m dying to figure out the name of it.",Does anyone remember what game this was?
Games,"I somehow missed everything about this game's existence until a preview popped up in my YouTube recommendations. I was really intrigued but I'm very conflicted. I've watched videos of the preview(s?) with the first hour or so of gameplay, DJ Subatomic Supernova and Sayu, and just finished playing through the current public demo on EGS with the YINU fight about three times. 

My impressions ? Good art direction, obviously; an original theme, a very well executed art style that's very colourful, great character design, expressive animations... it's what drew me in. The music is also very good, but I find it kind of odd that the guitar and drums only play when you're holding the button; it means you don't actually hear much of it during gameplay unless you go out of your way to stand in place for a while, play your instrument and hope you don't get hit. I feel that part wasn't too well executed; maybe instead of having a guitar/drum track overlay the music whenever you press Y, incorporating the instruments into the compositions themselves and having them appear more as the fight drags on and the completion meter at the top gets closer to Rock would have made more sense? 

I suffered a few technical issues. It seems the game slows down at certain points on my machine (Ryzen 5 1400/GTX 1050Ti) despite being able to run games with heavier lighting and more detailed scenes. At certain points, I suffered big frame drops; during phase 2 of the fight, when YINU's mom falls down and becomes vulnerable for a bit, the game would drop in the 10fps whenever I got close to her for whatever reason. During cutscenes, I'd also see these frame drops and it would lead to the animations being delayed from the dialogue. In addition to this, there are a few bugs. I got stuck in the terrain during phase 3 a couple times, the HUD somehow showed me playing the wrong character in my third run, and if you keep playing your instrument during the final cutscene and then start a new game, the overlay track keeps playing. I also saw some weird lighting in some places. Since this is a game that's still in development, I think it's fine that it has some technical issues, especially considering it's meant for consoles and I'm playing on PC, but I hope that they get fixed for release.

I have to say, though, the dialogue is... iffy. It's not bad, there's definitely more effort put into it than most games, but most of the jokes didn't really land for me and in some scenes, it was more annoying than anything. The inconsistent quality of the voice acting doesn't really help. Specifically, Mayday and YINU are plainly insufferable and very few of the VAs actually sell their lines (it's especially visible with Zuke). Some of them are enjoyable, though; I really liked DJ Subatomic Supernova and despite being meant as the 'annoying' character, Sayu's dialogue and VA was much more fun to listen to than anything Mayday ever says. 

The main issue I have with the game is the gameplay. I'm really not sure what to make of it. The first gameplay I watched was of Sayu's fight where, from what I understood, you spend most of your time navigating past some obstacles while Sayu shoots stuff at you and you try to follow her using grind rails as she runs away from you every time you get close. I didn't get to play it, but... it seemed awfully boring and frustrating. I thought that was just her gimmick, but no, it seems you spend pretty much every fight I've seen not attacking, but instead holding Y on stuff, picking up ammo and spamming RB. This gameplay loop seems kind of boring for an action game focusing on boss fights; the bosses' attack patterns aren't challenging enough to make that entertaining in my opinion. Even though the main difference we've seen between the playable characters is the way they attack, that difference seems more cosmetic than anything. The other one I've seen was the different active abilities they have equipped in the demo, but they don't seem that different either...

It's really hard to tell when you get hit in this game; not only is the visual effect very small and hard to see with all the clutter, it often feels like the hit is delayed; I think it's related to the very odd parry mechanic, which requires you to parry *after* you get hit rather than before unlike every other game out there. The whole rhythm thing is cool, but I don't understand why every game with this type of mechanic only has the enemies follow the rhythm and never the player, because the whole point of rhythm in an action game is to create flow; I don't get why they don't go further with it... Controlling your character in general doesn't feel too great. Attacks are missing some oomph, mobility is lacking... It's serviceable compared to some older games, but there's nothing interesting about the gameplay in general and that's sad.

To finish this rambly mess I just made, I'm interested in NSR but it feels like the game doesn't have much more to offer than its art direction. I'll be following the project, but I'm very conflicted about actually buying the game. 

I want to know what other people think about it ? I haven't seen any talk about this game on reddit despite being featured in one or two major presentations. Anyone ?",Opinions on No Straight Roads?

&gt;Rocket Arena is a blast with its unique take on explosive arena action, colourful cast and an ambitious game plan, albeit one that plays its payload cards a little too safely.

-------------

**[GameMAG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag)** - *Russian* - [8 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/rocket-arena-pc)

&gt;Rocket Arena has a lot of potential, and the game is worth paying attention to at least because of the original mechanics. It is a high-quality and interesting project that is definitely worth trying for fans of online shooters.

&gt;Rocket Arena is a fun and easy to learn shooting game. The fast pace of the game won't suit everyone but strengthens its identity. Despite lacking a depth of lore and strategy, the crossplay option can convince players to pay the price.

&gt;Rocket Arena doesn't have the most inspired and original characters or settings, but it does have 10 well-designed characters, three fun modes and solid gameplay that keeps you hooked throughout your frantic games. It's fun for fun, and many times we don't want more than that.

&gt;With a grand number of game modes, maps, and interesting characters with unique abilities alongside their personalized explosives, Rocket Arena certainly has more than enough personality to set itself from the pack.

&gt;Rocket Arena is an energetic new take on the arena shooter that revels in and rewards skillful play with its projectile weaponry. There's breadth to the cartoony character line up, and while their varied weapons and abilities muddy the purity of the classic rocket arena concept, you'll quickly find a favourite and get to enjoy the frantic scrapping of the game's various modes.

Games,"It seems that people are extremely confused by the recently released game '5D chess with multiverse time travel' because the game doesn't explain how the additional dimensions work, so I decided to post an expanded version of rules as I understand them.

# I. How chess pieces move in additional dimensions

I will try to explain the movement of pieces pretending there are only three regular dimensions we are all familiar with. For simplicity, let's imagine that the game is played on 8x8x8 solid cube.

* The rook moves an arbitrary number of spaces provided no space in the way is occupied. In two dimensions, the rook has 4 ways to move: left, right, up, and down. In three dimensions, the rook has 6 ways to move: left, right, up, down, forwards and backwards. In four dimensions, the rook has 8 ways to move and so on.
* The bishop moves in arbitrary number of spaces *diagonally in a two-dimensional coordinate plane* provided no space in the way is occupied. In three dimensions, the bishop has 12 ways to move: up+left, up+right, down+left, down+right, forward+up, forward+down, backward+up, backward+down, forward+left, forward-right, backward-left, backward-right. In four dimensions, bishop has 24 ways to move, making him extremely powerful. Look at [https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html](https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html) for visual illustration of three-dimensional bishop's moves.
* The queen moves in arbitrary number of spaces along any line provided no space in the way is occupied. In three dimensions, the queen has 26 ways to move. Of these 26 ways, 6 are the moves of the rook, 12 are the moves of the bishop, and 8 are true spatial diagonals: forward+up+right, forward+up+left, forward+down+right, forward+down+left, backward+up+right, backward+up+left, backward+down+right, backward+down+left. In four dimensions, the queen has 80 ways to move. Look at [https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html](https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html) for visual illustration of three-dimensional queen's moves.
* The king moves like a queen but only one space per turn. The king therefore has 26 possible moves in three dimensions and 80 possible moves in four dimensions.
* The knight moves two spaces in one coordinate direction and one space in another coordinate direction. In two dimensions, knight has 8 moves. In three dimensions, knight has 24 moves. In the notation of [https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html](https://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html), these moves from Cc3 are: Ac4, Ab3, Ad3, Ac2, Bc5, Ba3, Be3, Bc1, Cb5, Cd5, Ca4, Ce4, Ca2, Cb2, Cb1, Cd1, Dc5, Da3, De3, Dc1, Ec4, Eb3, Ed3, Ec2. In four dimensions, knight has 48 moves.
* The pawn is the only piece in chess whose moves make a distinction between directions. Here I will just say what are the pawn's moves in 5D Chess with multiverse time travel assuming you know how the board works (see section II for details). A regular pawn move consists of a single step forward either vertically or through timelines. A pawn capture consists of a single forward bishop step with no backwards direction. That is, a pawn on c3-4-1 can capture on b4-4-1, d4-4-1, c3-3-0, c3-5-0, c4-3-1, c4-5-1, b3-4-0 and d3-4-0 (hopefully, please try checking all these possibilities and tell me if something's not right).  
 

# II. Board and dimensions in 5D Chess with multiverse time travel

5D Chess with multiverse time travel is played on a four-dimensional board, 8 spaces wide in two of the dimensions and potentially infinite in another two dimensions, as new spaces are created during gameplay.  
A space in 5D Chess with multiverse time travel has four coordinates. Two spatial coordinates works as they do in regular chess and will be denoted in the same way: horizontal by letters a through h, vertical by digits 1 through 8. The third coordinate is time, which is measured in turns. The fourth coordinate is the timeline number. Therefore d4-11-3 denotes a d4 space on the 11th turn in the timeline number 3. Note that whenever you create the next timeline, it appears at the lowermost part of the screen while whenever your opponent creates the next timeline, to you it will appear at the uppermost part of the screen. For this reason we give the central timeline the number 0, the timelines to the the bottom (assuming you are playing white) the numbers 1,2,3 and so on, the timelines to the top (assuming you are playing white) the numbers -1,-2,-3 and so on.  
Let me explain how this four-dimensional picture is displayed on your two-dimensional screen. Originally the game displays a single chessboard, whose spaces are denoted a1-1-0 through h8-1-0. After you make your first move, the resulting position is displayed on a separate chessboard to the right. Be aware that this chessboard is not part of the game's active space yet because *the turn is incomplete*. After your opponent replies, the resulting position is displayed on the third chessboard to the right. Now the first turn on the first timeline is complete, and this third chessboard is the plane corresponding to the second move on the first timeline, hence its spaces are a1-2-0 through h8-2-0. In the Northernlion's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWj3VBgf3b4#t=13m7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWj3VBgf3b4#t=13m7s) , he, playing as white, decided to move a queen on d1-7-0 through time four turns into the past, clicking on the h5-3-0. This is when a second timeline is created, so after the black had replied, the queen actually arrives at h5-4-1.   
Now you can see all four dimensions represented visually. Let us call these little chessboards planes. Every plane in itself is two-dimensional 8 by 8 square, but each plane can also have planes adjacent to it. Dimensions inside a given plane are spatial dimensions, and dimensions displayed on a larger scale are two temporal dimensions. Planes to the left are located in the past, planes to the right are located in the future, planes in the upper part of the screen belong to an earlier timeline and planes in the lower part of the screen belong to a later timeline.  
As I said before, the knight and bishop in multidimensional chess move only in two dimensions at a time. The choice of this two dimensions can be arbitrary, so the knight and bishop can move in four different ways: a) normally; b) in one spatial direction and in time; c) in one spatial direction and travelling through timelines staying in the same point in time; d) moving in time and to a different timeline.  
For example, at 14:02 of Northernlion's video you can see that Bf1-4-0 is a valid move. That is because bishop is using mode d), moving from f1-3-1 one step to the right in time (i.e. to the future) and one step up in time (i.e. to the earlier timeline). At 14:39 you can see that the white queen has valid moves in all four possible combinations.  


# III. The order of moves in 5D Chess with multiverse time travel

A valid move in 5D Chess with multiverse time travel typically consists of a multiple chess moves across different timelines. Each timeline respects the order of moves borrowed from regular chess. In the original timeline, white move first, black second. In the timeline triggered by white's time travel move, black move first and vice versa.  
A present turn (indicate by the large white/black arrow through the center of the screen) is the earliest turn among all the end turns from timelines in play. For example, if the first time travel move happens to be from turn 7 to turn 3, then the present turn shifts from turn 7 to turn 3. But a time travel move from turn 14 to turn 12 will not affect what the present turn is if there is a timeline in play which only lasts up to turn 9. Similarly, the present is unaffected by time travels to the future.  
In order to complete your turn, you have to make a move on each active plane of your color located in the present. You can make moves on the planes that are located in the future, but it is optional. You can use up a turn on an active plane by either moving a piece *in* it or moving a piece *onto* it, so if you have two adjacent active planes, for example, and you move a piece from one to the other, your move is completely done.  
A time travel move is what looks like putting your piece on an inactive plane. In reality, the position on inactive planes can never be changed, so instead a time travel moves trigger a new timeline, with the position on that timeline copying the position on an incative board you appear to move into with the addition of the piece that appears to have moved into it (and, if it looks like a capture, without the piece that is apparently captured).  
In the Northernlion's video, clicking at h5-3-0 triggers a new timeline. As it was triggered by white, it receives the number 1. As the queen is arriving at the space located on the third turn, the new timeline starts its existence on the fourth turn after the black reply to the white queen's arrival. We can the therefore denote the resulting move by Qh5-3-1.  
Note that if you created a new timeline, then to you it appears to be created at the very back, and if your opponent created a timeline, then it appears to you to be created at the forwardmost line. This distinction matters, because pawns can perform interdimensional moves only one timeline forward.  


# IV. Checkmate

An important consequence of branching timelines is that you can apparently create an infinite array of fresh kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns for yourself, at the cost of your opponent receiving a handful of them also. If you have three timelines in play, you have three kings, and you are not allowed for any of them to be captured (checkmated). However, you can reply to an apparent checkmate in one of the timelines by sending your king to another one (or to the past, branching yet another timeline). The fact that there is no more king in one of the timelines has no consequences for gameplay, because all the timelines are inseparable parts of an integral four-dimensional chessboard.  
How does the checking king in the past thing works? Let me use an example of Rook Tactics I. Re5-5-0 is a check because a rook on e5-5-0 has an apparently valid e5-2-0 move, where the past version of the black king resides. No matter what the black do, after a single turn, white rook on what is now e5-6-0 still would have the freedom to travel 4 turns in the past, branching the timeline where the black king is immediately captured. We would then have two active timeline with only one black king survived, meaning that the black failed to protect one of their kings.",How to play 5D Chess with multiverse time travel

Games,"Hi y’all sorry for the poor wording of the title.

My question relates to a game that aims to tell a particular story or a particularly story point but then the gameplay massively disregards it or ignores it all together.

I can think of two scenes in two different games where the narrative and the gameplay misaligned.

There’s a opening scene of Assassins Creed 4 where you find yourself trapped on a deserted island with an Assassin who I believe was going to defect and I believe you kidnap his Garnets and meet up with his buyers to sell whatever the defected assassin was going to sell to the Templar’s, it’s actually a nice idea and a really interesting way of trying Edward into the Assassin Cause. 

The problem with this however is that you are tasked to protect the buyers from Assassins and you slaughter a lot of them to protect the Templar’s obviously at this point in the story when Edward doesn’t know what a Templar or an Assassin is but I always found it strange just how many Assassins Edward kills in this opening sequence especially since he becomes one at the end of the game.

Another one that is very commonly mentioned is the scene in Tomb Raider 2014 where Lara cry’s after murdering a man in self defence only to go full on punisher mode and slaughter her way through the rest of the game though this isn’t a Criticism of the game it was just odd that the scene was in the game to begin with

Games,"Half-Life: Alyx is possibly the best VR game ever made, and one of the best videogames ever created. A watershed moment for VR as a medium. There has never been a VR game this polished, accessible, and cohesive -- while conveying an experience only possible in VR.

But PC exclusives are often subtly ignored in GOTY awards. They might get awards for narrative, for art, and stuff like that. Disco Elysium comes to mind, for instance. The GOTY award is very generally handed out to a multiplatform game or a console exclusive. And certain genres are always excluded. Microsoft Flight Simulator doesn't have a chance of winning GOTY from most publications, for example, regardless of quality.

Alyx doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell in publicly voted GOTY awards because only PC VR gamers have played Alyx. If you asked the average console gamer to list GOTY candidates, they're only going to list console games, and will usually be biased in favor of their console of choice.

So we come back to the title question. Do you think Alyx will clean up at the various publication GOTY awards and also the titular The Game Awards, or will it be sidelined? Of course one can argue that there are several games this year that are worthy candidates for GOTY. But do you think Alyx will be given a fair chance, or will the demographic gulf between ""PC gamers with VR"" and ""console gamers"" work against it?","Do you think Half-Life: Alyx will be recognized by GOTY awards, or will it be overlooked because it's a PC exclusive VR title?"

Games,"""It's trying too hard to be like a movie"".

This is a criticism I see come up fairly often for big cinematic AAA titles. I've never quite understood it, though. One of my favorite things about games are their diversity. Online competitive, co-op, puzzles, walking simulators, shooters, character action, FMV, visual novels, etc. etc.

Yet whenever a game goes the cinematic route, the criticism that it's borrowing too much from cinema seems to always be a significant amount of the critique against the game. I would understand if it was a backlash against a general trend affecting all games in general, but most of the time it seems to be solely because people believe this is an inherently bad thing on its own.

The game I'm thinking of is *Empyrion - Galactic Survival*, an indie game that feels like one - the animations are awful, the sound design is no better, the AI is non-existent, the combat is mediocre and that's being generous, the story is presented through a bunch of uninteresting text-dumps riddled with typos, and vehicles don't even have collision physics..

..and yet despite all of that it's still a really enjoyable experience, because *Empyrion* is really a game all about spaceships and exploring space in spaceships. There’s a bit more to it than that but for the sake of brevity, spaceships - it manages to do One Thing really well and in nailing that One Thing its flaws become more forgivable.

Definitely worth a look if you have even a passing interest in spaceships or space exploration and don't mind a little jank.

&gt;Mortal Shell isn't merely ""like Dark Souls""; it's a love-letter to From Software's juggernaut series that successfully captures what makes those games special while carving out an identity all its own. It isn't without fault, yet as a freshman effort Mortal Shell is a worthy addition to the Soulslike pantheon.

&gt;Mortal Shell is an excellent entry in the Souls-like space with some fantastic ideas around character progression and combat, but is unfortunately let down by a health system that discourages exploration and an element of tedium that unnecessarily pads out encounters.

&gt;Mortal Shell gives players the closest experience to Dark Souls they've had since playing Dark Souls itself. If you're looking for a solid Action RPG that is reasonably priced to hold you over until Elden Ring or Demon's Souls Remake, Mortal Shell should be atop your list. It's not going to blow your mind, but for 30 USD it's hard to ask for much more.

&gt;Mortal Shell is another Dark Souls clone with nice graphics, interesting ideas and good combat mechanics.

&gt;Mortal Shell has enough fresh ideas to set itself apart and takes enough inspiration from existing titles to create a unique experience for veterans of the genre and new-comers alike.

&gt;Enjoyably tough and esoteric, if a little uneven, Mortal Shell is a decent debut from Cold Symmetry.

&gt;Wonderfully captures the atmosphere and combat of Souls games, but without enough tools to experiment with and an AI that's easy to abuse, Mortal Shell lacks meat on its bones.

&gt;Unfortunately Mortal Shell just feels like a bad Dark Souls game, while I enjoyed it initially, the more I played the more it wore away my enjoyment. The few unique features it has do make the game feel slightly unique but its world-building, combat and enemies pale in comparison to its inspiration. The bad AI and other small issues do little to complement what could have been an enjoyable title. There are far better games in the genre.

&gt;With beautiful environments and plenty to discover, Mortal Shell is a compelling world to explore. After a steep learning curve, its combat is challenging but fascinating, and with a great sense of reward once you master it. It might be a little too similar to Dark Souls in terms of overall tone and style, but it brings enough new ideas functionally to make it stand out from the crowd. Ultimately, this is a great entry into a demanding sub-genre that fans won't want to miss.

&gt;Mortal Shell is not the perfect Souls-like game out there, but it’s most certainly one of the best ones. It has its glaring flaws, but they’re drowned out by the amazing craftsmanship of the game’s creators and their taste for distinction.

**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [7.3 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/mortal-shell-recensione-rivale-dark-souls/)

&gt;Mortal Shell is a brilliant take on the soulslike genre, but it is still unbalanced and far from the height reached by Dark Souls series.

&gt;Mortal Shell boasts responsive combat and gorgeous visuals, but it's let down by rote level design, poor storytelling, and a general unfinished feel.

&gt;Mortal Shell is one of the year's biggest gaming surprises, offering a deep, fascinating journey into a melancholic world. It takes blatant inspiration from Dark Souls and Bloodborne,. But innovative tweaks to its combat and progression mechanics let it easily stand on its own two feet.

&gt;Mortal Shell retains the best elements of the genre - weighty combat, tension, exploration, and progression - and succeeds in refining a deep and beloved genre in ways that feel rewarding, familiar, and new, all at the same time.

&gt;Mortal Shell is to Dark Souls what Gears Tactics is to XCOM. It takes the tried and tested formula, wipes away all the years of hubris the original developers have grown accustomed to, and brings back the initial excitement of the first title. It works on those original premises and ideas and instead of replacing Dark Souls, it stands next to it as the new benchmark of the genre. In many ways Mortal Shell is as unpolished and raw as Demon Souls, but ultimately captures the heart and soul of what Dark Souls was, Dark Souls II wanted to be, and Dark Souls III only somewhat achieved. It is a beautiful homage to the original Soulslike titles and comes in strong as a competitor that will stand the test of time as the quintessential Soulslike game.

**[VideoGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/71/videogamer)** - Josh Wise - [7 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/mortal-shell-review)

&gt;If you're willing to devote a weekend to its mood of windbitten despondency (it's only fifteen or so hours long), you will not emerge from Mortal Shell unrewarded.

&gt;For any fans of the Soulslike genre looking for a new addition to their collection, Mortal Shell is worth the time. While there is room for Cold Symmetry to expand upon their ideas here and make improvements, they have absolutely proved their value as creative minds and talented developers.

-------------

&gt;More in line with From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice than a traditional Soulslike, Mortal Shell offers a short and sweet take on the hardcore action RPG formula by focusing the player to harden up and push the offensive in order to create the perfect defense.

Games,"When I first played Fallout 1 it was interesting. Almost like a well made horror movie interjecting comedy like It (remake).

But after playing 

* Fallout 1
* Fallout 2
* Fallout 3
* Fallout NV (not CRPG but same series)
* Fallout 4 (not CRPG but same series))
* ATOM RPG
* Encased
* Wasteland 2
* Outerworlds (not CRPG)

It just feels like they're all trying to shoehorn comedy in random places just for the sake of it. Unlike a well presented meal with garnish, it's just used as a main ingredient now.

Can't anyone make a serious grimdark post apocalyptic adventure with only hints of comedy in good place besides having all sorts of random comedic bits thrown at you between moments of somberness or seriousness?

I can't seem to think of any crpg that goes all in on creating a serious and grim world.

It makes sense to have a variety of writing in one piece but my point is that it seems the comedic aspect is overemphasized. Even in ads the messaging is look at this fun game, you get to kill people, make dialogue choices, and look! That guy has a USA themed hammer, and a ferret launcher! And we have animals that talk!

Nothing unique about exploring the post apocalyptic concept where humanity effectively killed itself and what happens next? Is it degression into medieval times? Do people retain some knowledge and work to build it up?

Why are the generic enemy unit always ""raiders"" who are like skinheads and use melee weapons? Who has the resources to get their raider army always so hopped up on drugs but not supplied with decent gear to make sure the drugs keep flowing? At least something to make me feel this isn't your own version of Fallout 1 or Mad Max...","Wasteland 3: Is the Post Apocalyptic CRPG Game Genre too comedic? It was neat the first time but now feels childish to have a character go on a philosophical rant when I use a clown hammer, a shrink bomb all the while throwing peepee snowballs."

Games,"In [Overland](https://store.steampowered.com/app/355680/Overland/), the aliens have won. This is not War of the Worlds or Independence Day, where microbes come to our rescue or there's some central-brain mothership to nuke. You are not there to win.

You are there to mourn.

Really, to say the aliens ""won"" might be overstating it. When humanity bulldozes the last viable habitat for a species, in order to make way for a football stadium, is that a ""victory?"" By the time you've made it into the late game, your very existence seems almost quaint. You're approached the same way idiot tourists run up to a grizzly bear, cameraphone in hand.

To be clear, in that metaphor, you're the grizzly bear. An apex predator brought low by a collective who brings ten more wherever one is slain, and those ten come looking for blood and vengeance. You are a titan of this planet whose once unquestioned dominion is now null and void.

You can strike back. But to what end? You'll be fleeing forever afterward. So you scrounge for what resources you can and make yourself scarce when the real rulers of the planet come to investigate. 

Overland is a game about surveying devastation. It's about watching old growth being clear-cut and something new being built, something you don't understand, something that isn't concerned with how you will eat. It gave me a sense of melancholy that I don't think any other game ever has.

It was lambasted at launch for being too hard, which is a real shame. I don't think it's any harder than something like Into the Breach, and if you liked that title, you'll probably like this one. It deserves better than ""Mixed."" Give it a look.

Thanks for reading.",Overland and the Xenocene
Games,"A spiritual successor to Zombies ate my neighbors is being made!!

So I don’t know if anyone here played the super awesome Super Nintendo game Zombies Ate My Neighbors but it was an ode to classic horror movies. Armed with squirt guns filled with holy water you would go through tons of levels picking up unique weapons and killing tons of different enemy types while trying to save the neighbors in the level. 

Now Demons Ate My Neighbors is being made for the PC and Nintendo Switch. They are running a Kickstarter to help fund the game. While I have no ties to the company I just really wanna be able to play this game on the switch so I’m hoping it doesn’t break any rules to post a link to the Kickstarter in hopes it will raise enough money to get made. 

Here’s the link for anyone interested. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tunedoutgames/damn",Zombies ate my brights spiritual sequel is being made
