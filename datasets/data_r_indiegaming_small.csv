IndieGaming,"I don't normally go completely out of my way for strangers, but looking at my own 4-month year old son, I had to post this somewhere than just a few social media channels.  More importantly, this is a fellow indie game community member. 

The ""Best Indie Games""  YouTube channel creator has been promoting indie games since 2015, providing great coverage and reviews where a lot of other outlets don't. 

Recently, he just discovered that his newborn daughter requires open-heart surgery. Basically, her heart is unable to provide enough oxygenated blood to her body. 

His family has set up a fundraiser, so any help they receive on that front I'm sure they would greatly appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At the very least, I'm just hoping people can take this message and spread the word.  I think doing this can go a long way and just show how strong our indie game community is in supporting each other.  :)**

IndieGaming,"Hey all.

Remember playing Contra on NES? Or Cuphead (for a recent reference). These games are quick, fast-paced, and shoot-em-ups, with the classic run-and-gun elements going for them.

Our game has the artwork done right (we believe), and we are working on the core mechanics at the moment. There are various types of guns and perks. Armors (mech suits) can be upgraded as you progress through the game and you can switch up your gameplay style by changing those elements. Missions can be replayed and killing the final boss awards you with a trophy. 

Though the level design has been working well so far, we would like to know what kind of gameplay mechanics (in the context of this game) would trigger your excitement the most? Is it just the 'run-and-gun' element or is it much more than that?

(you can check out the game details [here](https://www.macondogames.com).)",We are working on a game inspired by the old Saturday-morning cartoons of the 80s (like Centurions and M.A.S.K). What kind of gameplay would you expect from such a game?

I've always been fascinated with the potential of virtual spaces not only to be a place where people can play games but a place where people can make meaningful connections and build a real society.   
\`  
I believe that one day whole civilizations and cultures will develop in the digital just as they did in the physical.However, today, people in virtual worlds tend to build shallow relationships, they tend to be disorganized, and unfortunately there's always a lot of drama.  
\`  
\`

What would it take to develop a world in which people build real meaningful connections?

How do we create an incentive structure (through gamification) which will bring people together?   
\`

\`

What I want to do is discover what it takes to create real meaningful connections and possibly society in a digital space.

The game has 4 Phases: Dawn - Discussion / Announcements, Day - Tasks, Dusk - Voting, Night - Actions

As you can see, there is a new Task phase, in which the current ""Chief"" selects the required amount of players to go on a Mission. The others will then vote if they like the selected party or not, if the party is accepted the Task Party will then either Obey or Defy. If even one player defies, the task fails. Whenever a Task fails or a party is declined, a new Chief is selected. The Day phase ends after 2 Task Parties have been accepted or after the timer ends. **The Town wins after 3 Tasks succeed.**\*Note, Chief is not a role, just a title

You will be seeing returning roles such as Escort, Investigator and Transporter while seeing new ones such as Seer and Monk. There will be many new Evil Teams and roles coming, we are open to suggestions!

My goal is to fund the rest of the development using Kickstarter. When it came to building my KS page I researched many successfully funded indie games. My page is about 95% complete and I feel good about it.

The biggest challenge I am running into is getting people to follow my page during pre-launch and then getting my page in front of the right audience once launched. I've talked to a few others who have experience with KS and they all said that I should have enough support prior to launching that I am confident my campaign will get funded.

Right now looking at the numbers I don't think I have enough support. I am only trying to raise $5,000 but I currently only have 5 people following my pre-launch on KS. Combined with my Discord and Twitter engagement I don't think that if I launched my campaign today it would be successfully funded.

Ultimately I want to get in front of the right people but don't know how. I believe my game is a good idea and that I have enough of a prototype to get someone to buy in who is interested in similar games.

It is exactly one month after the Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom release. It is a turn-based strategy wargame set in WW2 + alternate history 1946. We want to share our first results with the Reddit community and discuss what could affect the release. 

Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is the fourth installment in the Strategic Mind line of games so I will compare it with our previous titles.

# The Strategic Mind games quality grows

We monitor all of the players feedback and we can see that although there is still huge room for improvement the overall feedback becomes more favourable with every title. Still, we better look at some tangible criteria for more precise and unbiased results.

**1) Median time played.** Median does not mean average, it means that 50% of the players played longer than this number. Note that the average play times for later releases are likely to still grow:

**Panzer Strategy (Released in 2018)**  
Median time played: 2 hours 16 minutes  
Average time played: 23 hours 50 minutes  
**Strategic Mind: The Pacific (Released in 2019)**

Median time played: 2 hours 23 minutes  
Average time played: 23 hours 58 minutes

**Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg (Released in Q2 2020)**  
Median time played: 4 hours 49 minutes

Average time played: 49 hours 55 minutes

**Strategic Mind: Spectre of Communism (Released in Q4 2020)**

Median time played: 6 hours 6 minutes  
Average time played: 37 hours 53 minutes  
**Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom (Released in Q2 2021)**

Median time played: 8 hours 10 minutes (and keeps growing)

Average time played: 24 hours 44 minutes

As you can see, there is a steady growth in the **median time played** which is a good indication that more players now enjoy the game for a longer period of time. 

**2) Steam reviews**   
We should, of course, account for the smaller sample size for the more recent projects. However, if we just look at the overall numbers we will see the following picture:

**Panzer Strategy** 

417 reviews 65% positive\*  
**Strategic Mind: The Pacific** 

429 reviews 76% positive\*

**Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg**  
271 reviews 87% positive\*

**Strategic Mind: Spectre of Communism**

92 reviews 92% positive\*  
**Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom**

37 reviews 94% positive\*

\*Only Steam purchasers’ reviews are counted. Newer projects have lower overall count since they are selling for a shorter period.

So, we can see that the Steam customers rate the games progressively better.   


# The Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom - not so good release

The most successful release so far was Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg.   
Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom got even better results in the first 12 hours - so we are grateful to our loyal community who supported us and got the game on release. 

However, this time we did not get nearly as much traffic from Steam. It is decided by very complex Steam algorithms that we do not know (to exclude any bias). Here is the number of visits from the two main sources of new visitors on Steam:  
**Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg 1 months after release (Released 22 May 2020)**  
Discovery queue visits: 136,274  
Steam homepage visits: 124,919  
Total: 261,193 visits

**Strategic Mind Fight for Freedom 1 months after release (Released 21 May 2021)**

Discovery queue visits: 51,033

Steam homepage visits: 12,605

Total: 63,638 visits

This means that Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom got 4 times less exposure on Steam despite a more successful day 1 sales. 

Basically, we did what we could to promote the game and the community supported us on day 1. Afterwards, we got less exposure on Steam and consequently much lower overall sales. 

**To make sure there is no wrong interpretation of my words:** we are not trying to accuse Steam or something, we are only wondering how the system works and how we as developers could predict it better for a more accurate estimation of future releases. 

# What the future holds

Despite this unfortunate setback, we are already working hard on the Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty that might become the last Strategic Mind title. We will keep you updated on our production progress, but the first maps are already playable and go through the testing process. The Spirit of Liberty will most likely be released in Q1 2022. We will keep polishing all the Strategic Mind titles and making sure they are up to date.

IndieGaming,I once watched a quick review about an indie game where the main premise was that the world restarted every minute an you had to learn the world in order to progress. It was pixelated and had black and white aesthetic. Can anyone remember the title of the game since I want to pick it up on the current sales. Thank you!,Will you help a fellow out?

Will put you in a hearse

Stab you right in the throat

For the coins in your purse

&amp;#x200B;

The gangrenous Leper

Has eyes that are sunk

Hacks off your limbs

With an audible ""thunk""  

&amp;#x200B;

The righteous Crusader

Will purge the land

Casts you into the pit

Ripped apart by the damned  

&amp;#x200B;

The prancing Jester

Mischievous is he

He slices your skin

With a cackling glee  

&amp;#x200B;

The esteemed Plague Doctor

Who's skill she has honed

Expels blood from your mouth

Melts the skin off your bones

&amp;#x200B;

The fearsome Hellion

Many foes she has slain

Cleaves you in the skull

Makes you bellow with pain

&amp;#x200B;

The lurking Abomination

In chains, he's enmeshed

Awakens the beast

Bites hunks off your flesh

&amp;#x200B;

The noble Houndmaster 

And his steadfast hound

Clubs you over the head

As you're pinned to the ground

&amp;#x200B;

The brave Man-at-Arms

Stands firm without yield

And knocks out your teeth

With the edge of his shield

&amp;#x200B;

The pious Vestal

Repent for your sin

Blinds you with the light

That she carries within

The mysterious Occultist

Makes the sun eclipse

Drags down to the whirling,

Chaotic abyss

The strange Antiquarian

A coward is she

Blasts smoke in your eyes

Forsakes her friends, and flees

&amp;#x200B;

The keen Arbalest

Shoots into the sky

Lands a crossbow arrow

Clean right through your eye

&amp;#x200B;

The shadowy Grave Robber

Holds a knife by the tip

Flies through the air

Pierces you through the lip

&amp;#x200B;

The relentless Bounty Hunter

Disembowels you, gored

He'll finish you off

Then collect his reward

&amp;#x200B;

The insane Flagellant

Cries, ""behold, the flood""

Strikes you with his lash

Till you're dripping with blood

&amp;#x200B;

The swift Shieldbearer

Will fill you with dread

Bites like a snake

Pierces you through the head

Not heroes, nor soldiers

But outcasts are these

Rejected and feared

They are hated, but free.

Or riches. Or fame.

IndieGaming,"Hey all. So as of late I've been hearing a few mixed messages about how capable the Surface Studio desktop computer is for gaming. Even some 2D indie titles, strangely enough, would seem to have trouble running on it. To this end, I would note that I also have a mix of both physical and digital titles for Playstation 4, which I mainly used back when I only had a MacBook Pro computer. From what I understand, the libraries that I purchase for PS4 would also be able to be played on PS5, and would be guaranteed to be playable. To this end, I was hoping that I could get some clarity as to whether the Surface Studio would be a capable gaming platform, or if I'd be better off going on with the Playstation ecosystem (I had also considered the Switch for sometime, but that would mean investing in a whole other ecosystem, and the shady anti-consumer choices they've made lately are a bit disheartening). Any input on the matter would be genuinely appreciated. Thanks.",Should I game on Surface Studio or PS4/PS5?

So far I have added 3 more enemies, 1 boss, custom UI, wave sequence, enemies logic, game logic, additional powerups, custom ship weapons, screen parallax effect, space atmosphere, and a few other things...but those are the major ones.

IndieGaming,"**CYBER SHADOW - My first impression**  

Cyber Shadow is a linear 2D Platformer with authentic 8 Bit Pixel Art developed by MekaSkull and published by Yacht Club Games. I've played it until chapter 5 so far and I really, really love it.    
 

https://preview.redd.it/lixgykv38od61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb88886696020cbf263c1cef3c2edfc18a8997b

  
First of all the game and level design is very good. It never gets boring. Until now there was no filler content. The difficulty feels just right for me, it's challening but not unfair.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/evvrkwxe8od61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f7920c27fb4f49535d4151f66998129e1f0bab

The game introduces new abilities and power ups all the time. For example, there is a throwing star and you can throw it at enemies by doing a well aimed sword blow on it.

Then when it comes back to you it overshoots so you can use it cleverly to fight enemies behind or around you. It feels a little bit like a satellite and makes a lot of fun using it.

There are two minor issues I had so far. The controls are very good, but I'm really missing a little bit of coyote time when jumping of the edge of platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 945197wf8od61...*

Sometimes it feels like hitting the jump button just one frame too late and your falling all down. And that is especially frustrating when your falling into a hole or something where you get killed instantly.

Another problem was that when an enemy is attacking me from behind and I wanted to do a turn followed by a sword blow it sometimes takes the input in the wrong order, making a blow in the opposite direction of what I've inteded to.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2podnkhg8od61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580f617b5796ea70dc6a2a28bb8c0908d0877d82

I also want to highlight the music which is composed by Enrique Martin and produced by Jake Kaufman, and it's one of the best chiptune music I've heard in a long, long time. It's really motivates you to push forward or creates very atmospheric mood in areas with lower pacing. 

Often the game is compared to The Messenger, but I think that comparsion doesn't do justice do it. Cyber Shadow is superior in all respects.

You might already have seen this game in newspapers or magazines. Also known as Binero, Takuzu, or Binairo, this puzzle game is simpler than Sudoku but can be as addictive.

Just 3 simple rules to fill in the grid:

1/ Equal number of whites and blacks on each column and row  
2/ No more than two whites or blacks side-by-side vertically and horizontally  
3/ No identical column and row

The game offers more than 1000 grids over 4 levels of difficulty and 4 sizes of grid.

You can also play the daily grid. A new one every day and the same one for everybody in the world (Yes, I am planning on building a daily world challenge. Stay tuned ;) )

However, outside of  Steam, Epic Games and other mainstream stores, a lot of free games are actually completely free and play more like paid offline indie games, these games can be found on non-mainstream stores like itch(dot)io, and some open source games have their own website. There are also fangames, which have gameplay based off the real games. For example, a really good fangame game i have played, Super Mario Bros X. This game allows you to download and create levels, but its complex more like GMOD and  Roblox compared to simple Mario Maker. [For example this thing you can download feels like a entire paid indie game, with a new story and characters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT2gvJt0pQA) It's a lot better than the average paid indie game, and doesn't suffer the cliches paid indie games have.

IndieGaming,"Hey All. I included a poll below, but the basic gist is that I'm moving forward in life and working towards a solid career out of grad school, and while I don't do a lot of hardcore gaming I still enjoy it on occasion, and was wondering what platform would be suitable to my tastes. 

I will note that I currently have a Playstation 4, though I don't use it as frequently as I had in the past before going to grad school (suffice to say, I ended up using the PS Vita more). I will also note that I work with two non-gaming PCs in a MacBook Pro and Surface Studio, both of which I use for my work in the arts and my studies in classes. I don't really have the budget to upgrade my computers, and don't feel that I really need to since they're perfect for the multimedia work that I do and I'm not really that drawn in to PC gaming. 

So I'm curious, for those of you who do find time to balance out their work lives with a bit of light gaming, what would you say is the most suitable platform? Any input you could give, or even a tip into the poll, would be very helpful in giving me some perspective. Thanks very much.

Between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC, Phoenician craftsmen disseminated original anthropomorphic terra-cotta masks throughout the Mediterranean region. The masks were placed in tombs to protect the deceased from the demons of the other world.

We are trying to see this object and imagine its world from the eyes of its creators and believers. This Art is one of those images that would take shape into our ancestors minds. The mask is possessed by sacred spirits that can communicate and chase the evil, thus protecting the soul of its holder from being torn apart and waste into the nether.  

We wanted to give this ancient artifact a new life through a game where fantasy is translated into a widely recognized language. That's why we shaped the effects of this card around the way Phoenicians perceived it: it empowers a unit.

IndieGaming,"Hey all. To make a long story short, I was close to getting my Steam account hacked, and I’ve started losing confidence in the platform. To that end I’m wonder whether I’d be safer from hackers if I stuck to gaming on a DRM free ecosystem like itch.io and/or GOG. 

To expand on this a bit, I was targeted by a fellow member of one of my Discord servers who reported me for permanent suspension; they claimed that they meant to target someone who had pirated a copy of the game we were both following, but accidentally linked my account instead. After I reached out to Steam Support to try and resolve the matter, they then linked me to the ‘administrator’ that they personally contacted. This person then sent an email to me to reset my password (through the official Steam channel), but before I went through with the reset I investigated the admin a bit further, and it turned out that they were a known scammer. I then proceeded to quickly block and report him to Steam; I couldn’t find the original poster in time before I could report them as well. 

While it’s good that I didn’t lose my account, my confidence in Steam as a whole has been greatly shaken, as this is the third time that my account has been wrongfully flagged in an attempt to try and hack my account; one of these times my account was in fact suspended. I was able to get it back a few hours after I got the notice, but in that moment I just felt completely numb for some reason. Not even sad or angry, just… empty. 

Now I don’t know if I’m going to end up going completely cold turkey on PC gaming, but I just don’t know how safe I really feel using Steam anymore, even though it’s the largest platform for new releases, especially for indie games that I love. 

Putting that into account, I have a history of making purchases on GOG, which I initially loved for their DRM free policies. I know that games don’t come out there as frequently as they do on Steam (not to mention some of the head that CDPR recently took after the fiasco with Cyberpunk) but I also feel that there’s a certain merit of quality that comes with the DRM free game ecosystem that comes with GOG, as well as itch.io to an extent.

But I’m curious to see what you all think. It might be that I’m jumping the gun a bit on this, but I’ve just been shafted by Steam so many times that I don’t feel as faithful as I used to. On the other hand, with such a vast library that I currently hold there, should I try sticking it through one more time, or do I count my losses and move forward on an alternate platform? Any input you guys might have on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",How much safer is GOG from hackers compared to Steam?
IndieGaming,"Hello, my name is Alexandr. I am the COO and the Lead game disigner at Starni Games — the game developer team from Ukraine. 

We have recently announced the next title in our Strategic Mind series - Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty. It is dedicated to Finland in WW2 and featuring three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. We are very enthusiastic about the topic, as we think that the story of Finland defending its land against the overwhelmingly numerous and powerful enemy is like a story from a legend. However, before the announcement, we have discussed this project with several industry experts, and they voiced concerns that Finland in WW2 is not as popular of a topic as Germany or Allies, so the project is unlikely to be successful. We had similar concerns in our team, but all things considered, we decided to dare it and go for this project. We would like to know what you, guys, think. 

Here is what we think awesome about WW2 wargame dedicated to Finland: 

# 1. Awesome story - a solid basement for great narrative

*Processing img sfs8xdxf5ln61...*

Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland’s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. 

We want to tell the outstanding and heroic story of brave Finnish people fending off the much stronger adversary several times over the course of WW2. Tell about the struggle and all the difficulties they had to face in their battle for survival.  

# 2. Historical background - good material for two campaigns

*Processing img fw2x38ug5ln61...*

**Historical campaign.** Follows a number of operations throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. 

**Alternate history campaign.** A shorter campaign with larger operations centered around the “what if” events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning. 

# 3. Unique atmosphere - brought through narrative, soundtrack, and cinematics

*Processing img j60isfph5ln61...*

We will try our best to immerse you into the time of this heroic struggle. To that end, we will have over 60 minutes of plot-driven cinematics with historic figures such as Baron Carl Mannerheim, President Risto Ryti, and others. As well as, special historic soundtrack, that would recreate the most iconic music of the time for the game, such as:

 \- Vapaussoturin Valloituslaulu: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtyScs6djU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtyScs6djU)

\- Njet Molotoff!: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl2\_0OCwNbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl2_0OCwNbg) 

Now, that is all good and well, but will the players be interested in the topic  dedicated to Finland in WW2? There is no better way to know than to ask them directly. That is why we asking: would you like to play such a strategy game? Please let us know what you think.

**Updates**

* We have up to 4 player Co-op work locally and online via Steam Remote Play Together! We were really excited to get this working. Dungeons can be saved and in the future labeled with the specific number of players needed to play them so you can make multiplayer dungeons that require players to work together to solve puzzles and complete them. The camera zooms out when players move away from each other, then turns to split screen when they get too far away. We're still refining this system but we're so excited to have it working.

https://i.redd.it/dfqgmf6q6tt61.gif

* Full controller support while playing (not designing). This works especially great for Co-op and so far we've found that most common controllers are compatible.
* Lots of new decorations: Bookshelf, fountain, tombstones, pillars, multi-colored carpet, grates, more floor tiles, breakable pots/skulls that items can be placed in.

https://preview.redd.it/o54i0kl4yst61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aabd52294c6c42ecfb6af5e37ec76166f2badb89

* Teleport pads and staircases! Doors aren't the only way to transition rooms anymore.  


https://i.redd.it/grm8xq4k8tt61.gif

* Boss door and Boss Key. The Boss Door can only be opened if the player uses a Boss Key. Bosses are coming soon!

https://i.redd.it/k6wm2efy1tt61.gif

* Gold Bow and Gold Bombs. These upgrades of the normal Bow/Bomb give the player unlimited Arrows/Bombs. 
* Heart containers. Adds one heart to your total hearts.

https://i.redd.it/re347ngx1tt61.gif

* Statue enemy. The statue activates if the player gets too close. It shoots out fire balls in 4 directions that curve and follow the player.

https://i.redd.it/2899omza3tt61.gif

* Repeatable switches. We have repeatable switches for the Orb Switch and Floor Switch. Triggering these objects more than once will make any linked objects that can change states more than once do so. For example, if a Repeatable Floor Switch is linked to a Closed Door, the door will open when the player steps on it but close if they step off of it.

https://i.redd.it/qiuftxlm4tt61.gif

* Room creation and expansion enhancements. We made it so if a new room is create it starts with walls and floor tiles. Expansion a room also expands the wall/floor tiles making it easy to edit rooms on the fly.

https://i.redd.it/ywkqbwae9tt61.gif

* Lighting enhancements. We have dark rooms that get brighter as you light torches. We also added a glow to objects the light up like the statue enemy and the orb switch.
* Arrow traps. The player can add an arrow trap to a wall tile, arrows will shoot out of the trap every few seconds. These arrows can trigger Orb Switches so it's possible to create some cool timed events using Repeatable Orb Switches.
* Set starting health and collectibles. There is now a section to decide how many hearts the player starts with and if they start with any bombs/arrows/keys.

I think that's everything. We are continuing to work passionately on this game in our spare time. We really want to get more feedback from the community though so we can make sure we're making a game that people want to play. This game needs a strong community around it at launch in order to be successful so we want to do whatever we can to foster that community. Please come join us in Discord and chat about what you would like to see in the game!

* A spoopy ghost!

* Gold as a currency to collect
* An NPC with a shop where players can use their gold to buy items in a dungeon

IndieGaming,"If you've ever played Rust, Ark, Travian, Evony or even RuneScape, you'd probably have experienced being ganged up and attacked by a bunch of bullies or zergs, or face the wrath of an entire clan.

RuneScape did try to combat this a little with some combat level restriction, but didn't work out because they didn't factor the number of people piling on one person.

Now, imagine owning a small town with some troops and villagers, and there are two other existing players with their towns. Everyone starts with a neutral diplomacy, and have a Combat Power (CP) that totals up you and your town's fighting strength.

Let's say that another player decides to war you, and there's a system that compares your CP with theirs. If it's not too different, the war is declared and a short preparation timer begins before any actual combat takes place, so that you have some time to prepare your town's defenses.

The third player notices this and wants to join in the ""fun"", and gangs up on you. But, the system adds his CP with your already warring enemy's CP, compares it with your CP, and find that it's too drastic, so he couldn't join in the war.

If their total was tolerable enough, you would have to take them on because your CP is nearly as much as theirs combined.

A player with a very low CP can initiate a war with a much stronger player, but a strong player would not be able to initiate a war with him.

Do you think such a system might work out?",A War System that's fair?

I need to start working hard on Unity/ Blender or any other software to turn my notebooks and draws into a “reality”… programming, art- design…

In my notebooks I’ve wrote about 4X games, traditional single player RPGs and MMORPGs.

Actually my goal it’s to develop an interesting and unique MMORPG… That’s a lot of work and I’m alone in this project, so I post here hoping anyone could be interested in join me to create a funny game without much pressure about time or others, because at the moment I prefer to see all of this about developing games as a hobby, not for earn money or need to run in the process of creation.

IndieGaming,"I'm working on a word puzzle game (about word meaning, not spelling), and I've long struggled with meta progression. What changes over time, other than moving from level 23 to level 123? 

Some players love meta progression, e.g., a rogue-like with unlocking new heros, ships, challenges and skills. Playing and grinding for weapons, items, and power-ups. Contrast with puzzlers and word games, where there's often no official progression, other than unlocking the next level, and your own personal skill in the game. You die, learn, and replay. Bittersweet but consistent, as u/hackup/ once said. 

In my game, I have 180 levels, and the content (words) and obstacles vary, the difficulty curve fluctuates up and down, and there are new powerups and mechanics, and overall, but there's minimal difference between the first hour, and 20 hours later.

IndieGaming,"I want to gather people who would like to help me develop a idea pitch to hopefully find a group of developers to create it. What I have worked out about what the game will be about I typed down here

What is this game? 

for summary, it will be a very mod friendly and supportive ( think of like Gary’s Mod) with a team based match that will consist of two teams with a equal amount of unique bases provided by mods. The players avatars also provided by mods can have one of the three ways of playing them,top down strategy, third person action, and first person shooter, and they have to go through enemy NPCs to take down each enemy base until the other side has none left. 

Why do I want this game made? 

I woke up one night actually remembered a really cool dream I had and it was playing the game of this very concept. It seemed so real I slowly lost interest in other games and became fascinated with this non existing concept. I had lots of good emotions involving this dream-born game and I am going to be doing anything I can to make this game a reality, even with my lack of skills regarding game development.",“Mod Multiverse” project

Hello, everyone!

I'm Saramantis and I am here to tell you about Heavy Metal Machines, a recently released game in the MOBA genre.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/n8r55gge0yw11.png

&amp;#x200B;

Heavy Metal Machines is a 4x4 competitive, filled with vehicle combat game where the team that delivers the bomb 3 times to the enemy base, wins. You can pick from different-skilled pilots with abilities that focus on transporting the bomb, intercepting the bomb carrier or supporting and healing your teammates. We also have tournaments happening, and already held big events with over €10.000 in prizes. Do you enjoy car battles and destruction with a touch of MOBA gameplay? Then give it a chance and check it out!

IndieGaming,"Almost exactly year ago, i've asked on r/PlantedTanks, r/evolution, r/Aquariums and couple other subreddits for a help with developing my evolution based aquarium/terrarium simulator, using natural/artificial selection principles of fauna and flora breeding. Year later, and after almost 3 years of development, **with help of around 30 closed alpha testers from Reddit** (Really brave souls who have fought over hundreds of bugs and even some bluescreens in very early versions, thank You all very much again!) - Creatura is in Early Access, publicly available for everyone at [https://store.steampowered.com/app/781130](https://store.steampowered.com/app/781130) .

In Creatura You can **manage a virtual aquarium/terrarium, grow &amp; trade procedurally generated plants, use realistic GCAT DNA editing tools to create and discover new fauna &amp; flora species** \- and with the very much needed help of Steam Early Access users, i hope to complete this most complex and education oriented vivarium simulator available on PC, and soon consoles/mobile (It's optimized well enough that Windows test builds are working fine on mobile, with save cross-compatibility planned for Beta version).

I've entered Early Access week ago, and after a week of daily 12h+ bug crunching - the project is in pretty stable state, waiting for more feedback, suggestions, and obviously testing. This doesn't mean Creatura is done in any way, shape or form. It's Early Access, **if You are interested in helping with the development and don't mind unbalanced gameplay that might crash from time to time - please check it out**, otherwise just add it to Your wishlist and wait until it's fully released.

P.S. If You want to play around with Creatura but don't feel like reporting bugs - don't worry, all crashes are automatically reported to anonymous public bug reporting channel, where You can see them all happening around the world live (and me desperately trying to patch them), but also **feel free there to also say hello to our testers, suggest a feedback or ask me for help** \- i'm on the channel pretty much 24/7 happy to answer!

^(\*Also i hope to not break the rules of this subreddit, Creatura is literally one man project, i'm as indie as it gets, and i just hope to get like-minded people interested in pretty unique passion project without any kind of marketing budget or even time to spent on promotion, so if it's not an issue, this might get cross-posted across some other subreddits.. I hope it's also not treated as spam, since the last time i've mentioned the project to this community was literally year ago.)","Creatura - Evolution Vivarium Simulator, is now in public Early Access"

IndieGaming,"Hi there, my name is Joel and I’m doing my masters in the field of Human Computer Interaction at the University of Basel. I’m currently conducting a survey about horror video games. In particular, I’m interested in the question why people play horror games and which game elements may affect the gameplay experience. As of now, I’m looking for people, that have played at least one horror video game at any point of time during the last 12 months and are kind enough to help a fellow gamer/student out by completing the survey linked below.

The focus of the study will be about a recent frightening horror video game experience you've had. This particular experience and the corresponding horror video game itself will be the focus of the rest of the survey. The survey will take about 30 min to complete and as a little thank you, you may enter a raffle to win one of 5 x 20$ Amazon gift cards. Obviously, all the information we collect will be stored anonymously so your name will not be associated to your data. All data will be kept confidential, will be treated anonymously and deleted after 2 years.

Note, that it is **not** important whether you like horror games in general nor whether you often play games of that genre. However it is necessary that you’re 18 or older and that you’ve played at least one horror games at any point of time during the last 12 months.

**Here is the link to the survey:** [https://ww2.unipark.de/uc/xphorror/](https://ww2.unipark.de/uc/xphorror/)

I would highly appreciate if you could spare some time and share your experience with a chosen horror game.

I, for myself always loved to play horror games. In my opinion it is extremely important to understand the viewpoints of the gamers of a specific genre to conduct good research about it. Therefore, I would really look forward to discuss my research topic with you in this sub. However, and I hope you'll understand this, I cannot discuss different topics of my study in detail nor gather opinions/input about it in the comments of this post before gathering enough participants for my study, otherwise I might bias my results. Therefore, I ask you to not discuss the questions of the survey nor the answers you’ll have given in the comments of this post until I have gathered enough participants, thank you very much. However, after enough of you participated, I would really love to start a discussion about the **specific** research topic and hear your opinion about it.

Thank you for your consideration and participation in my research project.

Edit: It seems that the survey won't get displayed properly on mobile devices. If possible, please use a computer, thank you very much!

Hi, I released A Game About, the first game project I have ever finished, today on Steam. It's available completely free, as I just wanted to prove myself I was capable of doing it and wasn't looking to make money out of it.

Here's the Steam Page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/927990/A\_Game\_About/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/927990/A_Game_About/)

It's a small project I made with Unity 2017 all by myself and I learned most of my coding skills while doing it. I got sick about a year and a half ago, I still am, and was in a position where I couldn't do much other than staying at home. I needed to abandon a lot personal projects, so making this game was a way for me to feel like I was doing something constructive.

It's very short, about ten minutes, though you cannot see all the content in one playthrough. It's obviously inspired by what I was going through at the time, but I'd say it helped exorcise my issues a bit.

Anyway, I'd love to have feedback, good or bad, if you want. I have other projects in mind, but for the time being, I need to take care of myself and keep it small as to not overwork myself.

Cheers!

Hey All. I decided to try doing this poll again, due to the overwhelming amount of love for the PC, and a lot of people railing on me that the turnout would be biased, I decided to redo this poll without any form of PC involved, whether it be desktop or laptop, Windows or Mac. I think at this point a lot of people will be telling me that PCs are the way to go to preserve indie titles, so I’ll have to invest in a good gaming PC for the future. Otherwise, I’m curious which gaming console separate from PC you guys would be worthwhile for the reasons I listed before: 

1. Dwindling physical media for consoles, or at least becoming more of an exclusive collector’s item. 

2. Japanese Developers leaning away from certain longtime console systems in favor of PCs. 

3. Preservation for the future, not just for myself, but for any friends or family that I may have down the line. 

Again, any input that you guys could give on the matter would be very helpful, and it should give me some greater perspective on whether I should keep investing in digital indie purchases for console games or if I should keep indies to the PC alone.

hi. Tarpit here, on of two devs on the new, free to play game Animyst. Animyst is single-shard, open-world, PVP&amp;PVE, first-person, potato friendly, physics-based combat with crafting instead of classes or skills.

some likely roasts of the game:

it's a pvp game and no-one plays it. -true we gotta start somewhere, and a few ppl do play it, and we've been adding more and more stuff to do when alone like base building and raiding and bosses

the graphics look terrible.

* the old school graphics allow us to make the game available on potato, and on mac including old Macs. the performance headroom goes into gameplay mechanics like having NO BUILDING WIPES

I suck at PVP. -true, one of our experienced players will hunt you down and craft magic with your blood

we update more than once a week on average and take player feedback very seriously. if checking out a brand new, free, weird af indie mmo is appealing, come thru

Hay All. So I've been taking some time to think about the impending status of games as a medium, and I'm looking for a bit of insight from some peers on what direction they thing the future of games will be taking. 

For one thing, physical media, I feel, is starting to spiral downwards, or become something more of a high-end collector's commodity for certain platforms. This shows not only in the fact that digital games tend to have better discounts on certain dates, but that retail prices for physical games from stores and especially scalpers seems to be escalating. 

Additionally, I've seen in some articles that a significant number of developers in Japan are at an even playing field in terms of developing for both consoles and computers, where in previous history they seemed to favor the former over the latter. It makes me think that if a country that leaned so strongly on console development for the longest time is starting to have developers switching gears, what that might say for their faith in the future of console gaming.  

I'm pondering on this not only for myself, but also for those that I may want to share my game catalog with in the future, such as family members or even kids that I may have later on in life. I'm the kind of person who does believe that games deserve to be preserved, and I'm wondering what type of platform might be the best to achieve that. Thanks.

IndieGaming,"Hi everyone!

I wanted to post an article here (an indie gamedev-relevant article) that I think would help other people who play indie games or indie game developers. It's also something I want to discuss. I'm only revealing my game details here because it adds context.

This is the article:

I noticed recently was that it is very difficult to play a 2D twitch game if you are only moving/attacking in 4 directions (this is why Larinite uses movement and attacks in 8 directions). The combat will feel clunky. I'm not talking about games that have free movement/or are point and click like action, FPS, MOBA and MMORPG games. I'm talking about games with movement with 4 buttons.

Games such as The Legend of Zelda can get around this because they have exploration and puzzle-based gameplay and simple (this is important) combat- no complex battles, not a lot of skill trees, combinations or enchantments. Another way to get around this would be to have attacking in all directions following the mouse (a game such as Relic Hunters is a good example of this).

I am transitioning away from making twitch based combat to turn-based (like Final Fantasy or Pokemon) because of this. You can see how twitch can potentially work in my previous videos and future demos. This is solely because I intended to make a game that was relaxing to play on mobile- I just realized that I don't want my players to smash their screens, trying to get actions done. If you are starting to build a video game, you can probably prevent this situation by studying controllers such as Playstation, Gameboy and Smartphones and not just PC before you embark on your game-building journey, so that you can find out what your core gameplay is before it's too late!

Likewise, before you purchase or back a 2D game, I would recommend that you get a demo of it so you can try it out- the combat could be frustrating later on just because of the limitations and the nature of 2D movement with buttons especially if only 4 directions are used.",Animations in 2D indie games (Movement with 4 buttons)

so the game got 17 Levels by now and my Quastion is that:

im enlisting to the army in two weeks so my schedule is going to get very problematic to say the least.

i'm gonna have around two days to work on the game every two weeks and i've been thinking recently about releasing a demo of the game since i'm not gonna finish it at this year and sadly the next too.

the problem is that i'm scared that allowing people to play the first 17 levels will destroy the hype or their will to purchase the full game when it would be released since they will have already played a significant amount of them but at the same time i'm scared of just leave the game a side, i've worked too much on it to just let it be and not be played.

 (the game planned to have 50 levels (and of course if ill ever have the time a level editor and multiplayer)

IndieGaming,"The way it works is based loosely on the ideas behind [WavefunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), with some major differences in architecture and a heuristic data structure I made to manage the timeline, called a Universal Wavefunction Tree. Frankly, it was a fucking logistical nightmare that haunts my dreams and the data structure is akin to a *lovecraftian horrer* when visualized, but after a month of theory, planning, design, and testing, the basic groundwork engine for such a game is complete and I'm working on a proof of concept to demonstrate it. I wanted to share this post because I've mostly been slaving away in loneliness and arguably neglecting my girlfriend for a month to craft this, and I wanted to share some of my ideas with the community to get a reading of what people would think of such a game, find inspiration going forward, or maybe find like-minded people who'd like to work on such a project, idk, I haven't really developed a road map yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what it's capable of: 

Every ""Object"" is instantiated on the timeline. Every object is derived from a sort of directed graph of discreet states that represent it's progression from ""preexistence"" to ""post-death"". The states can be just a straight timeline from birth to death or a more complex set of branching paths. During instantiation, the object is ""ordained"" in the timeline. This means that at the beginning of the universe (the ""Big Bang"") the object is in a pre-existence state, and at the end (the ""Heat Death"") the object is in the dead state (what this means depends on the object). Everything in between is in a ""superstate"" of possible states.

To find out what an object is at a specific date, it is ""collapsed."" to get an idea of what that means, check out the above link to the WavefunctionCollapse repo I mentioned. A collapse, at ANY POINT IN THE ENTIRE TIMELINE, is a near-O(1) procedure. This means that whether you travel one day into the future, or 65,000 years, the time it takes to collapse the state of the necessary objects is ALWAYS about the same, unlike pure simulation. This is made more efficient by the heuristic data structure I mentioned: essentially the state of objects are only collapsed if they need to be collapsed, which is determined by the structure.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets wild:

The date *might as well be a 64 bit integer.* A date is one day, so the range range of travel is from 0 to **\~50,000,000,000,000,000, 365-day, years.** Obviously, like minecraft, only a rich, miniscule amount of that play will be experienced by the player, and that's okay.

When you change things, those changes are saved, and the future states of those specific changes and states that depend on it are impacted, but here's the cool part: those changes are branched off, and the original states are preserved. **In other words, this is also a multiverse, and the player can have mobility between the different realities the player themselves have created.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the limitations:

The deterministic nature of the timeline engine means that effective seeding is impossible. Sharing ""worlds"" via seeds cannot be accomplished, because the actual events would still be affected by the order in which the player observes them.

Part of the design of the heuristic data structure involves an amount of inset ""layers"" of cycles the states progress on, and for efficiency, they're all powers of two. This prevents state progression from being too erratic for states that take drastically longer times than others to progress. Not so much as a limitation as an oddity, considering a month and a year has to be 32, and 256 days long, respectively (I mean, Stardew Valley got away with something similar, sooo...). Theres about 7 progressive layers, and I had to invent some that aren't real (my GF's interest in astrology inspired this system, namely [astrological ages](http://www.signsofthetimeshistory.com/ages.html))

As far as I can tell, cross-dependency between states of the same types is not really possible unless I can figure out the chicken-and-the-egg situation that arises, not to mention doing so would deliriously bloat the time it takes to collapse and trying to parse out what depends on what, all the way back to the beginning of time. This is partly resolved by a sort of aliasing layer on top of the engine, but it would take forever to describe the details of how that exactly works. The end result is that there's no true civ-like simulation of wars, conflicts and relationships between civilization entities, but if a civilization goes extinct, the aliasing layer determines a clear cause.

IndieGaming,"Last year I remember so many sites and people raving about Gorogoa, so I picked it up on the Switch recently and beat it today. I just didn't love it... 
I'm not here to say the people who loved it are  wrong, I'm actually quite jealous that they love something as much as they do; but I really thought it was just okay.
The hand drawn pencil art was spectacular, and the puzzles and gameplay were very unique, but something was just missing for me.
The story was incredibly ambiguous, and I had no  idea why I was doing anything that I was doing, which made it hard to stay invested and hooked.
What do you all think? Did you all like it? Am I just absolutely crazy for not loving it?

IndieGaming,"After being inspired by some of the amazing games I've seen here over the years, I set about to make a proof-of-concept of an Ace Attorney-style game a couple of months ago. It turned out pretty well, so I've since optimised it for browser-based play and uploaded it. It's just a short demo right now, and acts as a tutorial - but it's the ground-work for future additional episodic chapters of a larger story.

**Battle for justice in an anime-themed world as Nina Aquila, defence attorney and bona fide Legal Eagle!**

*Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle*  is an anime-themed graphic adventure game, in which you play the role   of a defence attorney. Fledge City is in crisis, and it's up to Nina Aquila and her friends to make sure justice prevails!

*Processing img dcm0tm3n4x321...*

With a tone that mixes crime with a light-hearted feel, a cast of quirky characters and a compelling story, *NALE* is intended as a homage to the Phoenix Wright franchise, but should appeal to all fans of anime &amp; graphic adventures.

* A fully-SFW graphic adventure
* Take the role of a new defence attorney
* Get to know a cast of quirky characters
* Defend your client in court!

The   game currently contains 1 case, which acts as a tutorial, and is   approx. 45-minutes to an hour in length, and is ""complete"", insofar as   additional chapters will be uploaded as new games, rather than updates   to this one. Future chapters will be more involved, with more of an   adventure theme, now that I have the basic system for the courtroom   stuff developed.

IndieGaming,"TL;DR *You come up with ideas, I’ll make it into a game.*

Hello everyone!

I think it is time for an experiment in the realm of gaming, one where everyone can get involved. It all falls under a single basic premise: **Reddit** ***designs*** **it, and I will** ***make*** **it**. You come up with the ideas, and I will execute them. A game becomes great because of its suggestions from the community, but what if a game’s design was *mainly* comprised of suggestions?

Here is how all of this will go down:

* I have a made subreddit called r/redditsgame, here is where all the topics for suggestions and any updates on the game will be posted.
* When I need a suggestion, I will create a post with the tag ‘\[Suggestion\]’ and flair of ‘Suggestion’ and what needs to be suggested
   * The comments section of these posts will be *only* meant for suggestions, and any other form of comments *will not be considered a suggestion*.
   * You may discuss suggestions as a reply to the parent comments, only *parent comments* will be considered suggestions. I will definitely look at these replies for more inspiration regarding the original suggestion.
   * Upvote the suggestions you like, and leave the ones you do not like alone.
   * The top comment at the end of a 24hr period will be the one I use unless it is outrageously difficult for me to accomplish (construct an MMO).
   * If your suggestion is chosen, I will record your name and the suggestion given and make sure to put you in the credits.
* This subreddit will be essential for \[Suggestion\] pages, but these will be stickied at the top. Feel free to post your own thoughts, ideas, images in the subreddit as well, I’ll be looking at them.

Here are some other notes on this project:

* This is *not* a AAA title, it is made by *just* myself over the course of the next year or so.
* I will be working on this whenever I have the time and will update my progress as often as I can.
* This is supposed to be a *fun* project, we will deal with issues as they arise, but this project’s purpose is to have *fun* and see where this could possibly go.
* Let’s stay away from anything NSFW, keep it rated around T for teen styled content.
* The more people involved, the more fun this will be, share this with your friends!

On that note, the first \[Suggestion\] is live ***NOW*** on r/redditsgame. It is titled ‘What genre should the game be centered around?’, and you can submit *anything* in accordance with my rules as long as it is attributed to the question at hand. This \[Suggestion\]’s time limit has been expanded from 24hrs to 48hrs so this whole experiment can (hopefully) gain a bit of traction.

I’m looking forward to working on this, let’s see how this goes…

IndieGaming,"Hello everyone! I would like to invite you test my new game: Tic Tac Poker!

Some  of you may remember this game from MSN =D As I loved playing  this game  against friends, I decided to accept the challenge to develop  and  release this app, and I would like to get your feedback (good and  bad),  before I release it to the public.

For  those of you who did not have the privilege to play this game, it   basically consists of a Tic Tac Toe board, but instead of playing with   x's and o's, you play with poker cards. You can then form combinations   of 2 or 3 cards in rows, columns, or the main diagonals, and each   special combination can award you some points. For example, a pair (two   cards of the same number), in the same row, column, or diagonal, will   award you 250 points.

Currently I have  implemented a (1) single player mode, where you take  turns playing a  card in your own board, and discarding a card in  another discard board;  (2) two players, where you can play local against  a friend (in the  future² maybe there will be a two players via the  Internet mode); (3)  vs computer, where there are 5 difficulties.

So, if you have any comments, feedback, suggestions, criticism, I will be answering in this thread.

Last, but not least, here is the link to try it: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brokoli.tictacpoker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brokoli.tictacpoker)

Disclaimer:  I am \*not\* expecting this game to be a big success; I  decided to make  it mainly because I would enjoy playing it in my phone  (and I think  these are the best apps = apps that the developer really  use). And I  can tell you that the effort have already paid itself (at  least for me  anyway, but I hope some of you enjoy it too!).",[Android] Tic Tac Poker

IndieGaming,"Hey All,

My experience is leading me to realize that I need to start my own gaming community.

Moon of Autumn is a gaming community to serve two purposes. One is to bring together people to play games, the second is to foster a community that values examining life and open discussions.

My particular orientation is to understand, through experience, what life is.

Happy to talk with any of you about that, and play some games.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

I am not really that interested in defining myself or this community via opposition to some other thing. However, I would like to mention that I have noticed in some communities and in the world at large, there is a trend to avoid conflict. This sometimes stops conversations that might be healthy to have. This community will specifically be about having those conversations, because we all have something to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

It will of course also be about community.

&amp;#x200B;

There will be no bans for talking about or making jokes, that are well intended. I want to specifically talk about current PC culture, right now, and say that if an Asian jokes about White people, or a White Male jokes about whoever, they aren't going to be banned or warned. However, if it is malicious or harmful, the community itself needs to intervene.

&amp;#x200B;

While this sort of thing in communities is often seen as fractitious, I want to say that I have seen the avoidance of these discussions leading to fractures in the community and not the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't have compassion for racists or what have you, any -ists, then it is ironic to have compassion for the groups or ideas they may or may not be -ists againsts.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I don't want to have the community focus on PC culture. It is just something up in the cultural Zeitgest at the moment and needed to be addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

\##################################################################################

I am also looking for active people who want to help grow this community, specifically.

I don't like to do that, but if I can't share my own work, nobody will see it, right?

I'm working on this game now, and I decided to release a pre-alpha with all the development tests i've made since the begining (2017). I need some support, so a friend recommended me this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

The game is **just** a love story, you work on Sugar Shake Diner, and it's your last chance to tell your best friend that you love her/him, so your coworker Luna helps you to set a **""perfect Last Date""** creating a good atmosphere in the Diner (with a Tycoon where you can customize the place) and also working on your behavior, to say the right thing at the right time. *~~But... I think that just like me, you're gonna feel that something is missing...~~*

&amp;#x200B;

In the Final Version, you'll be able to choose your character and also choose who is the person you love (Best Friend).

The choice of the Best Friend will actually influence in what he/her like or don't like, changing how Luna will work on your behavior in the game, and even changing the game soundtrack!

&amp;#x200B;

The Pre-Alpha has a **secret Minigame** and everything is really simple, but I hope you like it! Please tell me what you think, it's really important ♥  (Sorry about my english)

Hello, my name is Alex Cooper and I am the sole indie developer of a game called Allied Nations which recently debuted on Steam Early Access. I began work on Allied Nations back in 2016 and originally did not plan on using the Early Access system due to its bad reputation. But after watching the progress of Rimworld I was inspired by the community participation in development and the positive effect it had on the game Rimworld has become. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some personal discussion with the creator of Rimworld and with his encouragement and ability to advertise on his forums I decided I would take my game to Steam Early Access.  Allied Nations is an primarily online RPG/RTS akin to games such as Dwarf Fortress and the more modern RimWorld. You are able to easily manage units, wage war, build and roleplay. Allied Nations is not an easy game it is meant to be a challenging experience in its vanilla state. I have experimented with making the AI as intelligent as I possibly can to make the interaction with enemy armies feel real.  


 I hope you will give it a chance.  The games artwork might look low budget as many indie titles do but I have put my heart and soul into it. I wanted to make a game in a genre that I have always loved and have enjoyed, But I wanted to give it more of an original twist an a certain feature all games in this genre lack.. true multiplayer and not only multiplayer but lobby style multiplayer where players can host their own custom experiences to show of their creative expression in the same way I have been able to.  I would be highly grateful if you would do me the honor of trying Allied Nations.  ",Allied Nations

&amp;#x200B;

**INTRODUCTION**

Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Andreas, 21 years old from Norway. I've made fan games for about 8 years now, and I'm now making my first, full game that I'm going all-in on, and I truly hope it will turn out good. I've been working on this for about half a year, and thought about the story for about a year. Currently, only 1 level is complete, but I've spent much of the time fine tuning gameplay elements, balancing, detail work, and much more. I work together with a very talented pixel artist, and we discuss a lot about how the game should play, how all small details should work. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**GAMEPLAY**

The gameplay is a exploration, 2D horror game. You play through levels, each being unique with its own unique settings. You have base mechanics (Turn lantern on and off, hide under tables, etc) that are universal, but each level will force you to use these mechanics in different ways. Your mission in each level is to get to the end, but how you do that is something you have to figure out. The music in the game is made by me. You will also be able to unlock costumes and Equipment that will allow you to choose a ""boost"" to equip (Run faster, longer lasting lantern, etc). Some of these can be bought in the shop with coins you get by beating levels, while others are hidden within the levels themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

**STORY**

I won't go too much into the story, as it can take a while to explain, and I don't want to spoil it all, but in short: It's about a professor named Cornelius Guildeforde, who was raised in a religious home. As he grows up, he starts to question what he has been taught and start to search for the human soul. When he cannot find it, he eventually realizes that out world is all happening in our minds. All we see, hear, feel - it's all inside out head. That's where all the information is decoded. And so, that must mean ""we can decide what we want to be real and not, right? We can decide if we are good enough or not, what we want to focus on, what is real in our universe"". And while that can be a nice thought, he takes it too far. Cornelius, seing how the world is ""brainwashed"" by everyone living off what other people say, decides to create his own world; a digital world. He tries for years to code true consciousness. Because, ""who descides if a digital life is more real than this life, if out whole universe is inside each and everone's minds?"" He tries to create what he believes is the ""perfect human"", one who isn't affected by the truths and lies other people tell him. And when he eventually succeeds, he programs his own consciousness in this digital world, becoming a God, who wants to rule this ""more perfect world"". So we play as his experiment, his perfect human, Abraham, who is put to the test to see if he will be affected by the things he Cornelius got affected by or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you enjoy! I've worked so hard on this, and I've made games for many years now. I truly want this game to succeed. I truly want this game to be enjoyed by many, to end up on Steam, to be talked about and bring excitment to players. But I'm also afraid to say this, because I've worked on this for so long that I don't have the ""fresh eyes"" perspective, so I don't honestly know if this has potential, or if it's utter garbage. So please, give the Demo above a try, and tell me what you think. It means a lot to me.

In a shortcut, this father Crespi buys artifacts from local people in Equador and government want to shut it down. It's said that he does it to support the local starving community when the government is afraid that the country's legacy is being sold to a foreigner.

IndieGaming,"Hi! I'm absolutely new here. This idea has been in my head for a while now but I didn't really find a good place to talk about it yet. I haven't worked on anything yet, I just want to see what's the response to this idea.

I'm a huge fan of a variety of indie games and PvP games. I always wanted to do some live casual tournaments to show off new games but my friends won't really care if it's not Smash. So I tought, why not make an online league.

Two goals of this League would be:

* Show off and make players discover different small games (Doesn't have to be striclty independant but it won't be about Smash Ultimate and Hearthstone.)
* Create a casual PvP environnement.

The structure I have in mind is every two weeks a game is announced. Players would be in a Discord server, free to ""challenge"" eachother over those 2 weeks. After a match, they would report the results to the organisation along with a replay if they recorded one. After those 2 weeks, the leaderboard would be updated and a stream/video of the best replays would be compiled.

Also the whole thing is a ""no string attached"" kind of mentality. Don't want to buy the game or you just don't like it? Skip that one. Don't have a lot of time to play, play a couple for fun if you're availlable., not a big deal.

The kind of games that would be featured in such an event need a online PvP function and some competitive integrity so it's not just a random party game. I'm thinking of games like Tooth and Tails and Rivals of Aether. Maybe also stuff like Eternal and Minion Masters with a restriciton on the rarity of the cards you play. There are other games like Towerfall I would love to include but there is no innate online PvP and going through a 3rd party would be too much hassle for a lot of players.

It might also be possible to work in a couple of solo ""time attack"" or ""score attack"" style games but it's less interractive than straight PvP.

IndieGaming,"Hey guys. A little about me: multi award winning tv and commercial composer with hundreds of credits. Mostly do commercials now ([my reel here which even includes a couple Super Bowl spots](http://www.aaronpaullow.com)). It's a good living, but my heart has always been in video games every since I first extracted midi files out of Final Fantasy II in Cakewalk Home Studio just so I could learn every note and nuance!

Anyhow, I built a repository for my library (all tracks written by me, all of which are 100% self-owned/-published) that is searchable through keywords as well as a selectable UI. All tracks include uncompressed mixes and downloadable stems for all instruments. 

The categories are currently tailored to my advertising clients (the ""cinematic scores"" may be closest to your scoring needs) so I would like feedback on the functionality as well as what additional categories would be useful to you. There is also a bug that seems to prevent infinite scroll that some users have reported (I believe on the Win 10 Chrome browser) where they only see 6 results and we are trying to find the error code in the dev console so we can fix that.

It would be great to get some people to test it and report feedback and in exchange you can use some tracks you find in your game for free (albeit a non-exclusive license).

(If you'll forgive the shameless self-promotion, I'd also be interested in scoring some games if the project fits my aesthetic. If you're interested in an original score, feel free to reach out.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently trying to start a website for Indie Gaming. I have a few ideas that I believe are good, but I would really like some more opinions on the subject to make sure I'm going in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you be interested in interviews with Developers? If you're a Developer yourself, what kind of questions would you like asked in an interview with another developer? I have two written out and published to my personal blog currently and I think they're decent quality and somewhat interesting. My reasoning is that Indie Game Developers are from all walks of life and I've always found it super interesting to hear the background of developers and the individual challenges, problems, processes, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any type of Indie Gaming News you would like covered more in-depth? I see a lot of Indie Gaming News articles include click-bait and other things that amount to nothing.

IndieGaming,"My name is Mitja and I am the Community Manager at Journey Online, I am part of a two-man team - the other being our main (and only) developer - Jure, who made his dream a reality by spending sleepless nights working on his game.
We're both very pleased that after such a long time in development our game is nearing its full release.

But before that we have to open the game up to a new batch of players, all to gather that sweet sweet feedback, the mana on which we sustain ourselves.

Journey Online is a location based, co-operative strategy mobile game that provides players with challenging gameplay in which you have to recruit and train Adventurers, which you then use to defeat anything from simple monsters to raid bosses, and even other Adventurers. All of this can be done with up to 4 players working together locally, or across the world from each other.

We feel that the games focus on cooperative play and unique combat system will help it hold your interested far longer then other games of the same type that exist.

We loved all the feedback that we received during our closed alpha test, and it helped us shape the game into what it is today, that is why at the end of January we plan on opening the game up interested testers, if you want to read more about the upcoming Closed Alpha test, and other plans we have for this game, [please check out our newest development blog!](http://www.journeyonline.io/2019/01/27/development-blog-0-2-0-january-the-road-to-release/)

IndieGaming,"Hello all,

When I was a small child, I used to learn by heart spelling of different words by writing them multiple times. But it was not fun. I wanted to make learning different words some what fun for children. So I decided to work on ""Spelling Go!"" game which I am launching on Google Playstore and Apple appstore on 1st Feb 2019.

I wanted children to learn different word in a way that excite them or at least challenge them to to learn more and more. And not a boring repetitive process of writing them multiple times on a piece of paper. This I think what ""Spelling Go!"" accomplishes. In this spelling bee word puzzle game, you are presented with scattered letters on a grid. You need to guess the word that can be formed by those scattered letters. But this game is not just guessing the word. You also need to connect all the letters in a single path, line, connection or flow which starts from the first letter, goes through all the letters and then end at the last letter of the word. And the challenge does not end here. You also need to cover all the squares on the grid. No squares can be left empty. In this way, when you connect letters by letters in a sequential order, you are more likely to remember the spelling of the word. The following link is a gameplay video. What do you guys think?

IndieGaming,"TL;DR: I know Java fairly well, I'm in Grade 12. Should I learn Unreal Engine 4 or Unity 3D?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading up on Unreal Engine 4 VS Unity 3D for creating 3D games, and honestly I don't know which one to choose. From what I've read, the're very similar, so it's based around who you are for which program you should use. So here's some quick background information about me:

&amp;#x200B;

\- 17 year old Canadian, in Grade 12

\- Took Computer Science classes Grades 10-12. In Grade 10 I learned some Python, but I switched schools in grade 11 and they taught Java.

\- Got high 90's in those classes (I'm not bragging I know that I still have lots to learn to even start developing, but that's just how well I did in the classes)

\- Have access to all Adobe products, like Photoshop/Illustrator/Audition/Premiere, etc.

\- Have a powerful PC: intel i7 8700K, GTX 1070ti, 16GB RAM

\- My primary platform would be PC, but I'd like to support consoles

&amp;#x200B;

The types of games that I'd like to make are story heavy games, inspired by my favourite games like Life is Strange, Detroit: Become Human, Undertale, and Batman: Telltale. Maybe a little action put in if I can figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that Unity uses C#, and Unreal uses C++, so with my knowledge of Java (and Python to a lesser extent), I'm wondering which language would be best to learn. I'm also planning to watch a few hour-long tutorials on Maya this weekend to start learning that.

Hey everyone! We are VERY excited to be publishing[ ""The Outpost Nine: Ep. 1"" on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/882040/The_Outpost_Nine_Episode_1/). We will be releasing the game next Friday, July 20th. We'd appreciate the support, if you enjoy horror games definitely check this game out and wishlist :)

 The Outpost Nine - Episode 1 is a Visual Novel/Point and Click hybrid game following the small skeleton crew of “The Outpost”, a lonely mining facility set on the small moon “Cobalt Paradise”.  


While preparing the facility for the arrival of the rest of the Outpost mining crew, they accepted a distress call from a close-by freighter. While searching the freighter, they find two pilots, one horribly disfigured yet alive and only the remains of the other.  


However, the pilot they bring into the Outpost turns out to be host to a bizarre and frightened parasite putting the crew in intense danger.

## Gameplay

The gameplay switches between that of a visual novel through cutscenes and then into a top down point and click in gameplay. Actions in the game are chosen through a menu, in a similar style to Snatcher or Policenauts.

IndieGaming,"Hello Everyone!

Creating a game is no easy feat.  It can be challenging to manage assets, code, scripts, and production schedules. However, nothing is more frustrating (or frightening) than losing game data or important information. This happened to Estudio Ábrego a few times during the creation of *Noahmund.* As the team gears up for the game’s release, we’d like to share just a few nightmares they faced during development:

After a conference at Gamepolis 2017 to discuss *Noahmund’*s soundtrack, they lost the *entire* manuscript for the game. This meant that *all* the fixed dialogue and scenes for the game were lost. This forced the writer to rewrite the whole game with a whole new vision. It took a year for him to complete it, but he’s happier with the characters, scenes – and of course, the ending. It was a major setback at first, but it allowed the narrative for *Noahmund* to evolve into something even better. 

If that wasn’t enough to deal with, every time Estudio Ábrego moved from one office to another, their game repositories broke – and days of work were lost in the process. 

https://i.redd.it/5wbs3deyn6c11.jpg

Despite these challenges, *Noahmund* is nearly complete and will be available on Steam soon! 

What are a few of your game dev nightmare moments? Let me know in the comments!

The channel is still very new and small, but it's growing. I recently did an LP for Easteria, created by a member of our community, JonoExplainsThings, and it went really well! I also did an LP for a bizarre game called No Thing that sparked a bit of a discussion over on the Nintendo Switch subreddit. 

I'm now opening up my channel for submissions! I'd love to work with you fine, creative folks to get the scoop on some interesting titles. My goal is for this to be a solid, somewhat-niche but reliable resource for us to promote our work.

I only ask couple things:

Please subscribe to my channel: Not only does this help me, but it will also help you know precisely when your video goes up. 

Please help promote the video: Obviously this helps both of us!  Let your followers know there's some new coverage out there!  

Additionally, I might ask you a few details about the development of the game and your inspirations, to give viewers a bit of insight into the creative mind behind the project.

I also reserve the right not to play any games that I don't find suitable for my channel.

IndieGaming,"Hey folks. I just completed a new indie game. It's called Merge Together. The premise is simple. You must slide rows and columns to get all tiles of the same color to merge together. When all colors are joined, you beat the level. Each lever gets harder and more complex. It seems simple at first, until you realize groups of tiles might not fit where you put them. A last minute reshuffle can call for drastic measures!  


It's easy to pick up bit challenging to master. The casual gameplay is nevertheless relaxing, endless, and forgiving. There are unlimited levels and you can restart a level with a different puzzle if you get stuck. Its a game designed for the simple pleasure of playing, without any of the hassles of dead ends, levels that are too difficult, or reasons to quit.

Ayo! I'm making a game engine and writing a tutorial about it!

Whyyy?

Unity makes painfully clunky games, good languages like Python and Javascript are only good for making smallish games, and C++ is still super unpleasant to work with.

C++ is my least favorite programming language, but it's also still the best way to make professional games, the kind you can put on the Switch and in the Steam store. I'm not good at C++ and neither are most of the people I know, especially in the game making community.

I figure we could learn together and make something really nice. So I give you Honey, a free open source C++ game engine with a focus on simplicity, cuteness, and smoothness. Honey is a work in progress and always will be. Every piece of code ever committed to Honey will come with a teaching blog post.

I'm about 12 commits into making Honey, so it's still preliminary, though I can use it to make simple stuff like [http://friendsonmountains.com/ABearCs/](http://friendsonmountains.com/ABearCs/). But I'm making decently speedy progress, so some time later this year, it should be something people might want to use.

To make sure whether our work on the character and scene designs is on the right track, we came up with the second round of survey. It has 3 parts in general. First part is some basic information, and the other two parts are your opinions about the hero artwork and the scenes.

You can also participate in the game development if you want to leave some contact information, we will not use such information in other places aside from reaching you during the development of the game.

I'm excited to announce the first release that has been collaborated on by the entire development team, and we are excited to continue to expand the scope of our lovely little apocalypse.

**A couple of the recent things we are most excited about:**

1. Squad Raids are up and running! A very neat piece of functionality that will generate zombies and other survivors for you to fight against. No more having to wait in line to attack each other! We hope to continue to expand the NPC generator's use into scavenges and explores.
2. Quests! Our goal is to eventually create a sweeping story that will take players through the apocalypse, and we've created a few initial quests that will provide access to new items and features.

**Change log:**

Quests have been added!  
\- On your home page you will now find a link to the quest screen  
\- Warning. Some quests are hard! But you can cancel them at any time and pick up where you left off later.  
\- More quests will come soon.

Scavenges have been updated:  
\- Exp for higher level scavenges have been significantly increased  
\- Vaccine drops have been adjusted  
\- Item drop rates have been adjusted  
\- Most scavenges can now drop an item

Bleeding exp has been rebalanced

Squad raids have been reworked:  
\- Squad raids now assign a unique NPC to each member  
\- Each raid now have a fixed entry vaccines cost  
\- Each raid now have a fixed difficulty  
\- Squad raids now give limited edition items as a reward

Damage calculations have been updated:  
\- You will now do more damage on average, so draws will be less common  
\- You will now crit more, and more noticeably  
\- You will now miss more, but chance to hit can go up to 100%  
\- If you would have more than 100% chance to hit, you now can do a ""speed crit"" that does extra damage.  
\- The result of having much higher or lower stats than your opponent has been reduced

Weapons have ben rebalanced:  
\- Weapons are now much closer to each other in power. (Don't worry, ZP1 is still the best weapon in the game.)

NPCs have been rebalanced:  
\- NPCs will now be easier to kill from 50 hp. However, some of them has had their max hp increased to compensate.  
\- NPCs will now do more damage. Dying against them before you draw will now be a real concern.

New awards have been added!

Fishing has been added! It will be expanded on soon.

The game is played a slow pace role-playing game, as you progress you unlock more features and can be played from any device with a web browser. Please check it out any let me know your thoughts :)

I'll also gladly address any comments, questions, criticism, concerns, or anything else you may have (I apologize if this isn't allowed to be posted here, if it's not, feel free to remove it). Thanks.

###One Dim Dash
The game idea started out as a joke when considering pros and cons of 2D vs 3D games. The joke stuck in my head and I got more and more serious about it. I figured a one-dimensional game could not have jumping or steering, and settled on the fact that movement in a single direction only gives the player one element of control - the speed. The final design was simplistic and efficient, a square moving along a line and ""avoiding"" obstacles by having the correct speed. The game is quite arcade-y, where the only goal is beating your high score by getting as far as possible. It could be fun to challenge your friends and see who can get the furthest.

The scene is a cyberpunkish-retrowave city mixed with some noir elements. The game is mixing the open world gamestyle with some classic adventure game elements. NeonCode was inspired by films and games like Blade Runner, Miami Vice, Grim Fandango, Telltale games and many other.

&amp;nbsp;


So, I'm Lars, currently a 22 years old student in astrophysics and computer science. I've pretty much always dreamed of creating my own game, and had the vision for the exact game I'm developing now when I was 11. Back then I made games in Gamemaker because a friend of mine used it. Now, with more than a decade of programming experience under my belt, of which three years of academic experience, I've finally started working on it. The game would very much remind you of Mount and Blade when looking at the map, but with elements from Pokemon when it comes to battle generation, iced with a seemingly infinite amount of customizes and strategies to be explored.


&amp;nbsp;


Reason I'm here basically asking for money is not because *I* need it, but because the 3d modeller, a Finnish girl 3 years younger than I, recently graduated and is unemployed. The latter causes her serious financial trouble and may render her incapable of helping me develop the project and effectively forcing her to bust her ass doing a full time paper round. So I started a kickstarter for 1200 euro, to pay for 6 months of rent, which would allow her to stick with the project.

&amp;nbsp;


Further details and some very early media/raw footage of the game can be found here, including a link to the Kickstarter if you feel generous enough to help us out!

Loopadot is a free to play puzzle app with 168 levels (more coming soon!) in 4 game modes: Relax (an easy time-killer), Challenge (well... try it yourself ;-P), Infinite (endless moves) and a special Tablet mode with big levels.

You basically have a field of colored cirles and dots and have to move all dots into the right position with as less moves as possible while there is always only one free field you can move a dot in. No time limit. No pay to win. Guaranteed to be 100% freely playable and solveable (optional IAP for powerups in case you are stuck, but also rewarded video might help already and you gain powerups by solving levels with 3 stars, too!)

Me and my gf created the game some months ago and pushed out a major remake in the last weeks, learning from early mistakes! It's not yet very popular but the users playing it already love it (4.8 Rating in Play store!).

I would love to see some of you giving it a try! Feedback and ideas for improvement very welcome!

Warning: Not many have mastered the full challenge mode yet, but it's possible! **Can YOU do it?** ;-)

Here a screenshot from a tablet level as example :-) Smartphone levels are smaller and have a move limit.

IndieGaming,"So I'm sure that you've had a similar experience: you publish a game you've spent forever working on, and nobody notices. Or people notice, but all the reviews are either ""10/10,"" or ""It's trash."" Those sort of reviews are pretty useless, if you're trying to get better. You need *details;* you want to know what and how to improve.

My proposed solution to this is a ""Game Developer Review Club (from now on referred to as GDRC in this post)."" A site (or even reddit/discord server), where everyone on it is a published game dev (Itch, Steam, or self-published, it doesn't matter). There would be a semi-public fund where everyone in GDRC buys as many games as they can reasonably handle that have been published by GDRC members. They would then review each others games. Completion of games would not be required (albit encouraged), but the review would have to offer substantial advice to the developer of said game. The review doesn't have to be positive.

The GDRC would offer two main benefits to game developers: members would be guaranteed a certain number of reviews (which can help with marketing and discovery algorithms), and members would be guaranteed substantial critique of their work. The downside would be that they may have to play a few bad games (and break it to the dev that their work sucks).

IndieGaming,"Hello, I'm Marlow, Audio Designer for Temple Escape: Uncharted. Lexfrost and I have been working on the game for a long time, and I decided to find out how fast the fastest clear time could be in the current build. While doing so, I came to the realization that the game has the potential to be great for speedrunning, but there's one thing holding it back: wall jumping.

The issue: Wall jumping slows down the pace of the player during speedruns of the game. This would be fine, but in a game all about difficult maneuvers and quick decisions, wall jumping is very likely going to be the hardest part of the game to feel engaged in as a viewer. 

The discussion: 

-In a basic platformer, what mechanics or level design editions can be implemented to either make wall jumping more interesting or make it less tedious to watch? 

-What are some games that are good examples of interesting wall jumping mechanics? 

-What are some bad examples? 

-On the flipside, what are some good examples of level design choices that make wall jumping stand out?

We really want to hear from everyone. As with these kind of posts in the past, we've made changes to the game based on the responses we receive. Any feedback helps!

IndieGaming,"Hey gamers,

A few days ago we launched our latest version of Tap Battle Multiplayer (link at the bottom). 

We've been struggling with increasing the retention of the users and make the gameplay a bit more addictive.

Our idea was to implement a coin system (no in app purchases) and have the user bet a certain amount before each round. Secondly we added skins that vary in punching power. Finally we made skins store where users can purchase these.

It would be really helpful for us to know what you think of these new features. Do you think we should polish some things? Do you think the skin pricing is right? Got an idea for a skin? Please let us know.

We hope some of you will like the new game.

IndieGaming," **Hello!**

**Do you stretch the limits of games? Do you play with the rules rather than by them? Do you think games are creative?** 

I am a second year PhD student at the Institute of Educational Technology at The Open University. My project focuses on the little explored area of creativity in digital games, and what players may learn from being creative in games. This also includes what aspects of game-based creativity are transferable to other areas of life such as the workplace, other hobbies or formal educational settings.

I am seeking people over the age of 18 who regularly play (3+ times per week) a range of different digital games– online, offline, on PC, console, mobile or any other digital medium. I'm also interested in hearing from speedrunners, modders, AAR writers, fanfiction writers, game artists, developers and those engaged in any other game-related creative pursuits. 

**Taking part will involving filling in an online survey. To take part or find out more please visit:** r/https://openuniversity.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/creativity-and-learning-in-digital-games

No personal information is collected. You can provide your email address at the end if you wish to receive a summary of the research findings, resulting thesis or be included in further notifications about this project - however, this is entirely optional.

Also, if you know of anyone else who may be interested I would be very grateful if you could pass this on :)",Looking for creative gamers!

**Heya everyone, hope you doing fantastic!**

I made a game few days ago, typical clicker with puzzles in order to upgrade your clicking efficiency. I worked hard for the past weeks and months to make this game look good! The game is still in development stage, but I decided to take it out to public so I can get some reviews and develop it while you, as people who downloaded the game, would test, have fun and enjoy it!

Google Play - Riddle Clicker​

​

Game is totally free! There are ads, of course, but only when you want to get something in return i.e. when trying to get double clicking for 30 seconds!

​

Since the last time I posted, I made a ton of changes and updates to the game. First thing I added was roulette. It was a complicated process of making it due to different sizes in screen, but finally I made it. The next thing is wheel of fortune. It was less complicated, but still took a lot of time. I added more levels, more everything, fixed bugs etc.

**I UPDATE THE GAME DAILY, BECAUSE I LOVE MAKING GAMES**

So if you could, please, give it a try and review the game on Google Play. That means everything to me.

IndieGaming," Hi there!  
A friend and I have been working on a text game for quite some time, and we are finally just about finished!

I was thinking of ways to get it out there and figured this might be worth a look since text games are a bit niche in general.

We  both played MUDs when we were younger, and this enjoyment led to us  making quite a standard text game, which eventually grew and gained  features until it became the game we have now.

Basically  it's a text RPG with a 5 act story, featuring skills, secrets, images,  music, sound effects, boss fights, roaming monsters, random loot system,  quests and more!

We've also made the  engine to fully support a modular system, so people will be able to make  their own games using the engine, and fill it with all their own  story/art/sound/anything else. Without even needing to code!

If it sounds like it's something that's up your alley it would be great if you could have a look.

We are hoping to have the finishing touches done and launch it in the next month or so.  
Just trying to get the word out there and see if anybody might be interested in it.

* There are 20 different “machineries” that will change the environment and attack you during game. 💀
* For each 5 levels you pass you gain a new hat to custumize your duck. All hats are incredibly cute. 🎩

**The Game:**

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/800680/RTAG\_rise/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/800680/RTAG_rise/)

RTAG rise is a product of our (*Tim* and *Milo* of **Retro Active Gamers**) gaming play-through shenanigans. Inspired by the 2008 Super Meat Boy, we thought what it would be like if SMB had a co-op mode so both of us could play the game at once. Well that never happened so I (Milo) have set out to making my own game that evolved around our own story and that offered co-op option. Game design, programming, music and anything else is made by Milo while the all the levels in the game have been designed by Tim and Milo together. One makes levels to screw with the other.... and you get to be caught in the crossfire...

The game currently offers Full Controller Support and Local Co-Op

\- Currently there's a known bug which makes the game run slow on laptops that run on an integrated graphics card (intel integrated graphics) However, if you own a gaming laptop or any laptop that has a dedicated graphics card then the testers who have ran the game on gaming laptops reported no issues. This is a known issue pertaining to the engine used and the engine developers are aware of the problem.

**Current Access to the game:**

Originally we've set up RTAG rise on Steam Early Access in order to raise some funds to delegate some duties onto hired help. Since then we've been given a chance to see the flaws of the current release plan and come to a conclusion that, at this point, it is much more important to make the game more accessible than to make sales and raise capital. We need the feedback and a little bit of time in the spotlight to get a chance for some community involvement.

&amp;#x200B;

microcomputer, raspberry pi, etc, never laid my hands on any of those. I am a dummy programmer, and I know little about 3D modeling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1.Physical existance. Just use hologram.

&amp;#x200B;

[2.Design](https://2.Design) of the look. 3D modeling.

&amp;#x200B;

3.Her Soul. Should be able to perform the easiest voice-interation. I say hello to her and she should be able to say hello back. Thus, sound input and output would be involved here. In terms of speech recognition, there are simple solutions and extremly complicated solutions that's close to mission impossible for me.

&amp;#x200B;

OK, well, so now I know nothing. Starting from step one, I did none of these things before. I plan to record the whole process of me learning, making mistakes, making progress and how to put things together (maybe I will make videos of it), step by step, so other people can just follow me if they want, and make their own robot, until I stuck somewhere and cannot move on.

Virtual Girlfriend 101------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Step one, based on my research, there are many different hologram solutions out there.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are in USA, you can open Amazon to search ""hologram""/""3d hologram""/""phone hologram"", etc, and you will find some products available. Actually it is just a piece of plastic so if you are good at DIY, maybe you can just make one yourself.

IndieGaming,"My game is an open-world puzzle platformer, basically the structure of an early zelda game, an overworld with several levels you can go to at your leisure, with no real gate-keeping in the overworld itself. I'm not totally sold on my own concept for the overworld, and wanted to get some feedback about the kinds of overworlds you tend to like. How many more times should I write ""overworld""?

The terms I'm thinking in look like this: Is there a lot of gate-keeping/curation? Like early Zelda, every screen is unique and acts as a sort of mini-level or combat puzzle, and narrows the player's path. This foments familiarity with the world, and keeps player engaged. 

Is it more about exploration? I like freedom in games, worlds like Divine Divinity which are just wide open for you to explore. These worlds tend to feel overwhelming at first, and it would be easy to design something that's very boring. You can focus on design and making sure there are interesting landmarks along the way, but keeping it ""fun"" is the real challenge. Good enemy design is about all you can do if the environment itself is basically just wide open.

Is the scale tight or zoomed out? Thinking about the difference between, say, A Link to the Past and an SNES era Final Fantasy. Zelda would have dungeons effectively to scale, towns are just part of the landscape, it's very tightly zoomed in. FF has a much wider scale, dungeons and towns are single tiles, basically a symbol for what kind of areas it is.

My initial view of it was along the Divine Divinity lines, with the scale of FF, so very zoomed out, basically just a wide-open desert, with small iconic versions of the levels. There's not much gate-keeping in the levels themselves, you can acquire everything you need to beat every level very early in the game, so there's no reason players shouldn't have access to every part of the map right away. But I'm struggling to make that interesting, it's a lot of just moving in one direction, which feels like wasted time when the player could be engaged. Part of me likes the idea of it being low-key, but the other part thinks the wasted time thing.

What do you guys think? What do you tend to like? Any thoughts about these concepts?

Hi spooky friends,

We’re Spooky Doorway, three Irish indie game devs from Ireland who make games and are also based in Ireland. After meeting on a cursed island (of the coast of Ireland, of course…) we are now forced to make adventure games, the lowest earning of all the genres. And so we turn to Kickstarter.

Last year we released our first game, Darkside Detective, a comedy serial point-and-click adventure. Serial means it’s 9 cases long, each case investigating a strange event in the city of Twin Lakes. Thankfully, people liked it. It won some awards and reviewed well. And so we’re making a season 2.

(Ppppsssst! Season 1 is available on PC, Mas, Linux and Switch and is mid-port to other platforms too, so if you want to check it out you can find stores and the demo which features the first 2 cases [on our website](http://darksidedetective.com/demo/).)

If adventure games, comedy or having fun sound like your bag, check out [our trailer](https://youtu.be/3RkAKlAyo2Y) and our [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spookydoorway/1389705725?ref=535135&amp;token=93f8c94b), where you can find more gifs, details about the characters and more info on the team.

Like Season 1, we will to bring Season 2 to PC, Mac, Linux and Switch, but we need your help to cross the goal line (is that a phrase?). We’re at 75% with 9 days left so with your help we can do it!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that’s it, that’s our pitch. Thanks for taking the time to read it and let us know what you think!

I recently uploaded my game on Google Play, it classifies on the following categories : 2D Game, Casual Game, Fantasy Game.

You take the role of a Soldier, who's equipped with a Spear, Shield and Armor. Each one of this items are Enchant-able and Upgrade-able. The combat in-game is fought automatically but you see what damage you and the enemies are doing.

At the moment there's only 2 Stages with 100 levels each. (Each level represents an enemy). There's 5 achievements to complete and 4 daily quests with various rewards.

I ask these questions as a person who's been working on a project for a few years, and I've bounced back and forth between art styles over that time. I've come to a point where I can start making some finalized art assets. I'm curious about the kinds of things players are interested in experiencing from an aesthetic perspective, and why.  


Thinking about it brought me to a more general curiosity. It also got me wondering about how the trends work for indie games, and whether or not they were guided by demand.

IndieGaming,"So me and my team have been toying around with this idea for a while, and while it's nothing new, I'm not sure how often it's been the case with indie titles and debut titles.

Basically we wanted to add a mode to the game where you can listen to commentary on how the game was made. I love modes like that, and I'm stoked the remastered versions of Full Throttle and Monkey Island have them. They're made by pros, and while it's interesting to hear Tim Schafer talk about the design of a puzzle and the interactions of a big team, I think it would be interesting to hear complete amateurs talk about their experience developing a game. I'm not completely sure if anyone would want to listen to *our* team make dumb jokes and metal gear solid references, but *I'd* be all over it if another small indie game had it.

I think it could be educational, you know? And maybe helpful for people wanting to make a game but not knowing when and how to get started? If nothing else, you'd hear the mistakes we made so you wouldnt have to make them.

IndieGaming,"Review [here](http://www.lostkingdom.net/lands-of-lords-review-medieval-strategy-rpg/).

Lands of Lords is a deep city builder, feudal life and trade/economic simulator with a vast list of production daisy chains that mimics the trades and products that you would find within that period. It doesn't take itself completely serious with its setting, and does add in the occasional fantasy and other elements. Player interactions and the feudal hierarchy play a big role in the game, and RP is enforced within the official game communications, even thou a lot of the chat is done outside via discord so if you don't like rp you can still enjoy it.
The game world is absolutely vast with 3 main continents and a few other smaller masses. Each continent having its own biome, weather and local/regional trade markets, and if you have access to the sea then you can even access the global markets and make profit trading between continents. Trade is a big thing in the game, not only can you produce a vast variety of goods, but all those goods have different levels of quality and value. There is a lot to say about this game, which is why I posted the review to begin with. But honestly its one of those where you will always be learning something new even months after playing. 
I am part of a large empire within the northern continent of this world. We are currently in the process of expanding and would love to have a few more lords to join our ranks. We will help you settle in, teach you the game and support you as you grow. So if the review linked above, or my short inept blurb peaked your interest, come give Lands of Lords a try, and if you would like send me a DM and join the bears of the North as the first snows start to fall across the pines.

To be clear, this is from the viewpoint of a (small) YouTube creator, not a viewer. 

[TL;DR: Analysis of different types of indie game videos; what do you, as a viewer, prefer to see?] 

For the most part, indie games YouTube videos come in a handful of forms:

- let's plays
- tutorials/walkthroughs
- reviews
- short looks/plays/snapshots
- Dev trailers/feature showcases

There may be others, but these seem to be the general consensus. For the most part, each section can be broken down into key criteria that has an objective goal that is comparable to YouTube statistics. Any time a ""viewer"" is mentioned, presume that I am meaning a viewer looking for this specific game on YouTube, not the general population. 

- Let's plays are designed to play part/most/all of an indie game, in order to boost view time and subscribers, but viewers may just want to see what a game is about, and may only watch one episode.

- tutorials and walkthroughs often get a large amount of views, but terrible translation to subscribers, since its a ""come and go"" pattern

- reviews can take a lot of time and effort, and don't always cover everything. Like tutorials, they also have low translation rates of views to subs, and almost require a dedicated channel to reviews.

- shapshot let's plays often are short enough that viewers will watch through the video to see the game play, but lack the immediate viewership of reviews and tutorials, and often don't have ""continuation"" or more videos on that game.

- as many of the developers on here would know, Dev trailers can command a lot of attention if needed, but can take a lot of time and effort to make, and are often solely made by the developer. Again, these also have low conversion for subs, unless the game is an ongoing development (see rimworld update trailers for a very good retention and viewer base)

So, after all that, I want to ask you, the viewers, the players, the developers.

IndieGaming,"So yeah, as the title says, I didn't quit my day-job to pursue the tough life of being an indie game developer.  Instead, I opted for the ""safe"" route of game development by actually having a steady income haha.  I didn't realize it would take me 8 years to release a game, especially since it was my goal to do everything myself!

I did the programming/music/art/everything for ""Super Bugman Extreme Ultra"".  I launched Early Access on Steam on January 2nd of this year expecting to sell millions of copies and buying my own private island.  Once reality set in, I was only able to buy a cheeseburger.  My Tax Consultant laughed in my face.  I aimed to have my release date on March 30th, which I thankfully hit, only completing the entire game a few weeks prior.  I mean, the game was ""done"" when I launch EA, but I wanted to bugfix, polish, and add some new content - with the help of some reliable beta-testers I was able to do all that in the following months.

I've created this game from scratch in C++, using only the SDL library.  Sound Effects and Music were made using royalty free clips that I arranged in Ableton Live Suite.  The graphics assets I made in Aseprite, however, all the character sprites and many of the level sprites I used from my first attempt at this game when I made it in QBasic in the late 1990's.  For my ""release party"", I streamed my attempt of getting the original game working; while I was successful in my attempt, the game went *badly* due to horrible code, controls, and scrolling.

If I haven't chased you off at this point, I'd love to know what you think!

IndieGaming,"Hello guys!

I've just recently started this project and after several evenings of work it turned out to be something I'm willing to play for hours and I can't wait to share even though it's probably a bit premature. Project codename is Overpower.

The game is inspired by Bullfrog titles like Populous, Magic Carpet and Dungeon Keeper. It's written in pure Javascript, which makes it absolutely free, open source and running inside the browser. I may define the genre as God Simulator, Fantasy World Simulator and Zero Player Game.

There are no gameplay goals and never will be, you have to come up with your own causes (you are playing God after all). At the beginning of the game you appear in a world with some trees and rocks scattered around, maybe some animals. At the same time 2 portals open from which people start entering the world. 

They will survive, gather food and materials, hunt and mount animals, form clans, share with each other, build houses and castles, establish towns ruled by lords, craft weapons and wage war against others. Then suddenly another portal opens somewhere and new people come trying to fit into the living world. Regardless of your participation the world will continue to evolve. You may just observe what's happening or possess some person and control him or even lead masses of people somewhere they shouldn't go. 

Color is a fundamental game mechanic and affects nearly everything. To avoid spoilers I won't go into the details of how exactly this works, but understanding the color circle is a key for understanding the game mechanics.

So I invite you to try it right now:
[Play Overpower!](http://appday.ru/op/overpower.html)

Press C to switch the view from top-down to first person and back. 
While in top-down view, left click on a character to possess him. Right click to stop possession. 
Press SPACE to give orders.
Use browser zoom (CTRL-+, CTRL--) to get a comfortable scale. 

Looking forward to your feedback.

**Warning!**
Always keep the browser tab active or just play the game in a separate window. Otherwise it won't run correctly.

While it may run on a mobile device, the touch controls are not yet implemented.

..Where I've since made 50 or so content updates and improvements. Every time I think it's just right I will think of something cool to add, or a better way of handling something, or take player feedback into account and make the necessary changes for a better experience.

Maybe it's the Roguelike genre in general. Are they ever supposed to end, development-wise? Can't they always be improved upon in some way?

IndieGaming,"Hi everyone! I [posted on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/8a7jmj/my_game_just_hit_50_downloads/) a few days ago because I wanted to share with someone the fact that I got 50 installations of [my game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olivercheok.busjump). The response I got from you guys was so overwhelming and humbling, and I'm honestly so deeply touched by all of the support I received from this community.

I've been going through some pretty rough times in my personal and family life lately and I've been learning to code to help keep my mind off of things. My friends and family were hardly interested when I told them I had hit 50 downloads, even though to me it was a huge achievement, especially since my goal initially was to get 20. When you all showed me such kindness it really gave me the pick-me-up I needed and I want each and every one of you to know that I appreciate that so so so very much. More than once, reading all of your comments and kind words brought tears to my eyes. I cannot thank you enough for that.

With all that being said, I thought maybe you guys would like update on how my app is doing. With all your support, my app jumped from 51 installations before my original post all the way to 333 installations as of writing this one. It also reached the top 200 of Casual New Free games in 6 countries, including the United States. Never in my wildest dreams did I envision reaching anywhere near this. All of your guys' support means the world to me.

I also had the opportunity of talking to other game developers, and talking about their games as well, in comments and via PMs. Some of the games mentioned were truly amazing, like [this game](http://littlecodingfox.itch.io/fairtravelbattle) by u/LittleCodingFox. If any of you reading this are game developers, feel free to mention your games in the comments for others in this wonderful community to see.

Since we officially released Zapoco, just over two months ago, lot has changed since! We've made a ton of progress since launch, and will continue to do so by adding new content daily to the game to always ensure there is something new for our players. We've introduced a ton of new skills and content since the last time we posted. We also have a mobile version of the game, so you can play on your desktop, phone, or even a tablet \(and a mobile app in the works\)!

We introduced one of our biggest features yet, which was the **Land/Harvest system**. The land system has been a huge hit for the game, as it gives players the chance to buy land from the global map. Once land has been purchased players can sow and harvest each acre every 6 hours, once resources have been harvested they can be sold on the grain exchange.

**Side Note:** Since this does get asked usually, the game is completely free to play \(F2P\), and we have no advertisements at all in the game either. We are able to stay afloat thanks to support from our players; in which we do have donator packages you can purchase. However, you can also obtain these in various ways in the game completely for free, and no purchases are required by anyone. We greatly appreciate everyone who supports us via purchases, but they are not required to enjoy the game!

IndieGaming,"Hello,  
I know indie gamer is kind of generic and it depends of the community but I wonder where indie gamers search for new games ?  
Usually, devs advertise their games inside dev community, wich are not their playerbase, they are like friends that test the game to support.  
Gamers are ""everywhere"", but you, as a small game that nobody knows, you can't really post everywhere.  
I have some reddit subs, but I wonder if there's more to know ! Or if it's mostly just having the luck to be seen by big website and get an article there.  
Kinda new in this how to market your game/where to find players. A lot of website just say : ""go post on reddit in the subs X,Y and Z"", ""talk about it"", ""make a twitter account/facebook account"". But I mostly wonder where, as a player you go to find games, or, where as a dev, you find your playerbase.

. It seemed very similiar to how Rainbow Six Siege plays
. It USP was that the maps generated were all RNG , meaning that each layout of every map of every single game played was going to be different. This proposed teams to think and play tactically to adapt to the unique map for everh game that they played.

IndieGaming,"I just started dating this girl that's really into indie games. Problem is  that she is going away for 2 months during June and July which is what it is. I'm thinking a nice way to still keep in touch would be to play something now and then when we both have the time and continue dating through some co-op indie games (that can be played online).

I haven't played that many indie games (or smaller titels) in the last couple of years and would like to hear from the community what you guys would recommend in this situation?

I know she prefers co-op games so it would have to be co-op games that you can play online with each other. Indie titles or smaller games. Oh yeah, she's really into pen and paper roleplaying games and fantasy in general. So maybe games similar to Divinity: Original sin would work (don't know if she has played that on)? So co-op suggestions similar to that would also be welcome.

Games that I have thought of:
Stardew Valley (co-op that is in beta)
Terraria

Even after I made the ASO I still have zero organic traffic, as my game was to long on market with just 100 installs. So now I'm thinking what i can do, until I finished the game and made a full release to the app store, and amazon.

Do guys think this thing could work?

1. The game is puzzle. So I thinking to find similar games on steam or android stores. something like ""monument valley"" or TIS-100, or maybe table top simulator. Contact those authors and buy 20-30 keys from them (sorry, i can't afford more). And then make contest here on reddit (in /r/gaming or another subredit where admin will allow that). 9 people who get most bigger score will win one of the key. the same thing repeat on another social platform (maybe twitter, or facebook)
2. Make special version of the game for twitch for ""twitch plays"" stream. where people will play the game together. And while the game is active on stream the same SID can be played by anyone on mobile (separated mode).

Also. I need to note that this game is something like a barley-break. it quite hard and for specific auditorium which is really small. Probably something like all chess players vs all FPS game players. (I see that across total 200 install i have just one guy from Korea who still play this game for longer than one year, and those 200 installs was from specific (gamedevloper) auditorium).

I don't think that publishers will be interested in this kind of game, so I'll be happy to hear your advises how can I find my auditorium.",Guerrilla marketing ideas/questions.

IndieGaming,"Hello. My name is Filip, and I'm an indie game developer. Recently we released our first game. The game is a shoot-em-up game turned on it's head with some rogulite and arcade elements in there. We're proud of the project, we worked on it for the last 2 years, yet it's sales numbers haven't been that high. That's the first reality check we had to face. Is the game bad? But then we would have a lot of negative reviews, yet we don't, most of them are positive. Is the game boring in the long run? Well it could be true, but why do so many people hang out on our discord server and play the game for the last few months. Is it too hard? Well we're sure it's not for everyone. The game was made to be hardcore rogulite shooter, but than more of the hardcore rogulite players would surely come and play. Well to counteract our fears we tried to make an update to the game in the hopes of engaging the existing players and giving them a better experience. The update released a few days ago and added additional content and quality of life improvements to the game. We're also planning a new update really soon, and after that, we plan to release new content. But how much do you, the actual gamers value updates? For me, as mostly a console gamer I'm not used to much updates. Only rare games put out updates and fixes on a regular basis, and with my busy schedule I mostly finish a game and don't give it a second go even if it gets updates. My main question to you /r/IndieGaming is how much do Indi players value updates and new content? How long do you stick with an indie game title?

IndieGaming,"*TL/DR:* We're developing Zeal, an online ARPG focused on PVP, and we're going to run a series of playtests, where you can play the game to check its early state and tell us what you think!  

More details in discord: https://discord.gg/WH8xuh3

Our latest gameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIJxAadAzHk

# Key features of the game
  
## No grinding or leveling####
Forgoing traditional MMORPG aspects, in the world of Zeal you login and pick your character. Once you've done that, you queue right into the action! Be it solo mode or with friends, Zeal is MMORPG combat with none of the MMORPG grind.
  
## Completely customizable classes
No character in Zeal has a predefined role. Their abilities, appearance and stats are all able to be altered. You create a character custom-tailored to your specific design and taste.
  
## Focus on PvP
But it will also include multiple PvE modes of play. Dungeons that will challenge your skills along with both single player and co-op campaigns await for all those who can stand to stop fighting each other long enough!

# Gameplay

Zeal’s combat depends on strategy, positioning, reaction speed, aiming and teamwork.

As players thrive to master their build, they must read enemy strategies quickly, trying to predict their enemy depending on what kind of spells they use while synergizing with their teammates.

Fast-paced combat and realistic physics allow Zeal to keep up the feeling of fluid gameplay. Dynamic weather, environmental destruction, adaptive AI and many other features will await you in game.

# Classes

The game will have up to 15 classes on release: Brute, Judicator, Naturalist, Wizard, Warrior, Shaman, Outlaw, Ranger, Witch, Cultist, Lancer, Shapeshifter, Beastmaster, Archbishop and Exile.

There will be a class for every player! With profound customization options such as picking weapon styles, abilities, stats and perks, players will be able to play any role they want: Tank, Support, Healer, Nuker, Bruiser, DoT- or Pet-Oriented DD and all sorts of hybrids.

# Gamemodes
Depending on results of our future Kickstarter campaign, the game will feature:

## PvP 
— Arena mode: 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3, casual and rated, with ladder and seasons   
— Conquest mode, where 35 teams of 2 players fight for dominance on a big map   
— Battlegrounds: from 5v5 to 20v20   

## PvE 
— Dungeons for small groups (1-5)   
— Single player &amp; Co-op campaign   
  
# The Lore
  
Zeal takes place in two worlds with fates entwined by corruption of an unknown, malicious force. Haltorn, also known as the old lands, is stuck in an ever-straining phase of truce with all it’s kingdoms, clans, guilds, orders and cults.  
  
As a treacherous rift opens to an ill-fated new world of Archea, lords of the old lands send their best champions to investigate, scavenge and conquer it.  
  
Little they know the savagery that awaits them... Can they emerge victorious after all?

You'll need to manage your own clinic, hire personnel, make acquaintances and even develop romantic relationships with some of the characters.

  
The medical part is a simulation which is inspired by 90's classic games such as ""Emergency Room"" by Legacy Games. There's also a complete medical codex about ailments you might encounter in the game.

The game is a Medical Simulation Visual Novel with adult elements \(that doesn't mean it's a porn game at all, it's more like The Witcher 2 in sexual content\) and the adult part can be skipped completely using a particular setting.

As of alpha version 0.0.14 the most important features are:

* 36 unique medical examinations
* 3 game modes \(*Story* for the complete experience,\* Vanil*la for the story without sexual activities*, Examinatio\*n for the medical exams only\)
* 18 story arcs \(events that revolve around one or more characters\)
* 2200\+ high\-quality images
* 40\+ Achievements
* Random events while exploring the city
* Random Examinations for an almost endless experience \(children only right now, teens/young adults/adults and elders coming up next\)

I had a little go at Orc Colony the other day, spent around an hour playing it, and thoroughly enjoyed myself, despite the games existing flaws.

It's available on Itch.io and is currently in development, hence the flaws.

The game is a lair building game where we view a dungeon side-on, like the side-on view of Project Highrise, and you place rooms for your Orcs to interact with; bedrooms to sleep, mines to work, smiths to smelt, that sort of thing.

The Orcs can then be banded together, and armed, to go and raid human settlements.

It's a fun game with a lot of potential. Visually it's great, gameplay-wise it needs some work but the dev is well aware of this.

IndieGaming,"# Making our first indie game - Wats! VR Pest Control

Lorcan here \- the 50&amp;#37; of Birdmask that is programming and 3D art. Having just launched our first game Wats! Vr Pest Control onto the store, there is finally a bit of time, so I thought I would do a write\-up to share our experience, as a 2 person startup, of getting a game developed, published and on the Gear marketplace.

![img](84zzd91dd8311)

Wats began development about ten months ago. I had just completed a BA in Computer Games Arts at UCA, Farnham, and been offered a place on an incubator program that supports post\- grads releasing their first game, in exchange for some hours each week as a teaching assistant

Jo had completed a fine art degree at CSM, and having used game engine technology as part of her degree\-show, she was keen to collaborate on a project. Initially her involvement was as a casual consultant, but as I hit problems with design and scope, she stepped in to a full designer role, as well as handling all the online and launching stuff.

![video](lcttib0qd8311 ""It's funny, Mac was all the way there back in stress testing, not in the final game though."")

As a student I had worked with the HTC Vive and, by chance, around this time mobile VR, like the Gear and Daydream, were just getting motion controller support. I was interested in the possibilities of mobile VR, plus being lower in price and more convenient to use I thought they had the potential for a bigger audience than their PC counterparts.

As I had to replace my very tired iPhone anyway, I decided to invest in a Gear VR headset and a Samsung phone. While I knew developing a game for relatively new tech would involve some extra difficulty in development, I had high hopes it would payoff as being a good way to get some extra visibility for a new studio in a emerging marketplace.

**Room Attack**

After some initial stress testing to see what the Gear could handle I started developing the first iteration of Wats, then called Room Attack.

It was a month or two into this when we faced our first roadblock as a new developer team. The idea seemed simple enough \- a kind of Home Alone style game. You had your room and got points for breaking things and scoring combos. Each time you break stuff, you make noise. Too much noise and the owner runs in \- game over! Like I said \- sounds simple!

![video](x983w69ci8311)

But it wasn’t long before problems began to appear. While I could code each individual system for the game, actually putting all those systems into one functioning and publishable package, that worked together, was just too much for a first release (with one multitasking programmer). You really can’t go too simple for your first game, and even if you can code something, doesn’t mean you’ll be able to make it work in the wild.

**Rats?**

So Jo and I had to go back to basics to figure out the essentials of what we wanted to do. Enthusiasm for the project was at a low, so we needed to find a way to use what we had so far, but adapt it into something more manageable for the Gear.

We tried to figure out what we wanted for a Gear VR 'experience’ that we didn’t see in other games? The main thing I wanted was for as many objects as possible to be interactive and for them to have a straightforward tactile quality \- even if it was just throwing and breaking them. I did not want glass bottles glued to the table. This is Vr you want to pick things up and throw them! With that in mind we decided the main elements our Vr games should have to offer are:

1\- Exploring and searching an environment.

2 Aiming / scoring with precision.

![gif](oxvp8awbi8311)

After a bit more brainstorming Jo combined these elements together by adding a ‘target’ \- rats \- into the mix, and we had a new concept. Search/trash the room, find the rats and catch them before they disappear \- and if possible add some humor and charm to the mix by adding the colourful character of Mac Kennedy \- and make some special interactable objects like the dart board and turntable to give clues to his backstory.

This revised concept worked much better, no conflicting or overly complex scripting systems, just a room full of fun toys, text and a clear objective that worked with the controls.

**Development For The Gear**

There were some unique quirks to developing for mobile VR compared with PC. Debugging was near impossible on the phone, and testing any changes on the Gear itself was a major time commitment \- each test required a new build and upload to the phone. To get around this I would only ever test on the phone after a lot of experimenting on the PC, which required developing some extra PC side inputs to let me test things in the editor, where I could see the error logs.

![video](gu2do7srg8311)

From this point, development went pretty smoothly. Unity seems to have integrated VR development a bit more than when I started a year ago, but getting the inputs to work was simple enough. With a simple goal in mind I took the rough controls from Room Attack and remade them in a fresh project, with some extra visual flare (the grabbing glove), and then brought over the old assets to work in the new scene.

**Publishing**

Since we only had a Gear, the Oculus store was our only option for release, and unlike some other stores, it has curation that we had to pass to get through. This was a risk, but something we had considered and set as a goal when we started development. If we wanted to make games properly we needed to be able to make them well, and getting through Oculus quality control would be a good marker and confidence boost for us, as a studio going onward.

Before submitting our game, we had a good look at all of Oculus requirements \- no visual glitches, control standards and so on \- and made sure to test for these as best we could on our side. It’s nerve racking putting your first game out there. Going from unfinished prototypes to actually putting something up for sale, wondering if the second it goes on the store everything breaks, someone finds some game breaking bug you never discovered, or someone has some problem you can’t reproduce.

Fortunately we got through the review process with near to no hiccups, and as a note on Oculus they were very thorough with their testing and feedback which put our mind to ease. Within a month of submitting Wats to Oculus, it was ready for release well before our target time and it was out there!

**Post Release:**

Which brings us up to date. Since its release we’ve managed to shift a few copies through the store, and have been sending out review codes to as many outlets that cover VR games and titles as we can find. Jo and I keep an eye out for any feedback, and for potential errors anyone finds in our game, so we can work on them as soon as possible (So far so good on the error front).

![img](f41r2n5zg8311)

We are both very happy with our release. The feedback we’ve gotten has been mostly positive and the community around the Gear has been fair and constructive. We’ve learnt a lot during Wats development. There are things we are very proud of, things we know to work on, and things we look forward to advancing in our next game. We hope we will be able to start development of our second title before too long and release on the store in the future, once Wats is safe in the water.

IndieGaming,"Hello fellow indie game enthusiasts, 

This is a project I have been following for a while and felt the need to share. Right now it is in a stage compareable to Steam Early Access. Axie Infinity is a game that allows you to collect creatures called Axie and battle them in 3v3 battles. In this respect it is similar to games like Pokemon. Additionally, you can breed Axie with each other once certain conditions are met to create a semi rng based offspring. Each Axie has its own unique genetic code that determines its looks, parts, stats, and moves in battes. You can also care for your Axie in a Terrarium via interations like feeding, bathing, and and putting it to bed. You can also decorate your terrarium with items as well as let each house multiple Axie friends. This is similar to pet games like Neopets. How well your Axie is cared for can have an effect on its battle performance. 

Axie Infinity is not a normal game. You do not buy this game as a download code or on steam. Axie Infinity is built on the ethereum blockchain, and Axie are non fungible tokens on that network. This means that to play the game, all you need to do is buy an Axie. After playing for a while and putting your time into your Axie by leveling, evolving, and creating a strong team, you can sell it if you so chose to. Axies are traded in the crytocurrency Ethereum, which can be converted directly to and from dollars or other currencies. All Axie have value because, for all intents and purposes, they are are they key to the game. Also, while their price is determined by rarity, battle potential, etc, they are equal in that they can all perform the same functions. 

I see this model as a new genre that directly combats everything despicable about freemium and microtransaction based games, while keeping the fun elements. Taking that a step further, I believe that the fact that Axies are all non fungible tokens, meaning you have direct ownership over them, is huge. We have seen this to a lesser extent with CS:GO skins and other similar mechanics, but never before has there been a real game, in a gamers sense, that imparts true ownership of all digital assets at its core.

Planned features are as follows:

Battles (coming in ~ 1 month)
Terrariums (with raising and other minigames)
Tournaments
PvE gameplay (campaign, adventures, dungeons, multiplayer PvE)
Other yet to be announced modules

I wanted to make this post fairly brief, so many of my explinations do not tell the full story.

If you are interested I highly reccommend you check out the reading materials on the website, AxieInfinity.com. You can also find the full roadmap there.

Also, check out this teaser of what battles will look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erWDpTZo7as

IndieGaming,"So I came up with a video game that is a third person/first person combat game where there are multiple factions from multiple eras of human civilization. Every player controls one faction and everyone in it from the highest ranking official to the grunts on the front lines of combat. Players will be able to jump between characters when killed the player becomes the charictor in there faction nearest to where they were killed. Each game will play out on a map approximately 36 kilometers square and players can setup various bases to get more vehicles soldiers or equipment. The game is lost by one of the enemy players taking over your capital base and killing the leader. Once a capital is taken over you get all the equipment vehicles and soldiers that your enemy once had. Gameplay continues until there is only one faction left and the player who controls the faction is declared winner.

Servers will work by one player hosting the match and others joining, there will also be a stand alone app to host a dedicated server to save on computer resources.

My company Fuzzi Studio just launched one of our games as early access on [Itch.io](https://Itch.io)!

The game is a twist on the standard twin\-stick shooter that tasks you with simultaneously controlling two characters: Lil Bro, whose job is to smash into enemies, and Big Bro, who can collect the coins they drop. Killing enemies increases your multiplier but collecting orbs is the only way to earn points, so juggling between the two roles is vital to getting that highscore.

When you start a match of Vampire Slayer: New Blood, you’ll have to  choose one of the unique characters available. Although you’ll  eventually get to pick from a larger number of characters, there are  currently four specialized characters to choose from. On the  bloodsucking side, you can choose from either Eric or Malissa. Unlike  Malissa, Eric is a vampire in disguise, walking among humans and hiding  in plain sight. To aid in his sneaky endeavors, Eric is able to turn  invisible for short periods of time, a power that will be tremendously  helpful on the battlefield. Malissa is a bit more mysterious and has  hidden origins, but an equally impressive power. Malissa is able to see  through walls, locating enemies and taking them down. These vampires  can’t go unchecked, though, and you’ll be able to take them down with  one of the two vampire hunters. Firstly, there’s Jill, a tactical  vampire hunter that likes to burst down her foes. Using her signature  MAC-10, a machine pistol with a high rate of fire, Jill swoops around  the map spraying her foes with bullets. Joining by her side for the  first time is Pablo, the newest vampire hunter to be added to the  roster. Pablo is dark and brooding, using a shotgun to blast his  enemies. Pablo’s strong will and resolute faith make him unaffected by  the cross weapon, which will give you a strategic advantage during  battles.

IndieGaming,"Hello!

I would like to get your opinion on the driving of a car i made for the game i am working on.

You can give your feedback directly inside the game that you can **download here** :  [https://visumeca.itch.io/eisproto-wip](https://visumeca.itch.io/eisproto-wip)

It's playable on PC and testable in less than 5 minutes.

Note : it's not going to be a parking game but you will need to park sometimes in the game.

It's not going to be a racing game. Think of it more like a quiet GTA-like.

Thanks !

IndieGaming,"Hello dear ""IndieGaming"" community, we would like to share with you our latest DevBlog about the Exile Villages that we plan to add to The Universim game, some of you might already heard about it. We hope you'll enjoy it and leave us your comments. We will try to answer your questions in a timely manner.

*Processing img t2fmj8e631511...*

Exile Villages will pop up around the planet. These villages will grow alongside your own, eventually threatening and attacking your civilization. We think these villages offer an amazing opportunity to test your Creator Powers. However, you may want to refrain from rushing out to wipe them off of the face of the planet, as they could also offer you something very valuable. 

*Processing img snkda0da31511...*

Exile Villages will be formed by Nuggets who have lost faith in you. Certain actions or a lack thereof might cause Nuggets in need to become frustrated and leave. Of course, there will be situations where their demands are completely ridiculous, so it’s almost impossible to please everyone. There could even come a time when you must choose between helping one Nugget or another. 

*Processing img kwf8kice31511...*

Every Exile Village will have its own population, threat level, and evolution progress, which you can reveal by clicking on them. They will contact your civilization’s leaders with demands or trade offers as time goes by. Refusing or ignoring these messages will, as you can likely guess, end in conflict. 

*Processing img 53mzruug31511...*

Our design philosophy with The Universim is to give you as much choice as possible, ensuring you have the ability to decide the outcome of almost any situation, either by ignoring it or taking control. We want you to decide how much you engage with and influence the world. We know that many of you enjoy the micromanagement aspects of the game, while others prefer to lean back and watch over their civilization as a silent observer. 

Exile Villages will be making their way into the game sometime after the Steam Release. Please let us know your thoughts on the new system. What kind of interactions would you like to see? Do you have some cool ideas you’d like to share? Don’t be afraid to drop us a comment!

All the best,

A couple of words on Letteral: It is a social word game for iPhone and iPad. While having a solid vocabulary certainly helps, following the right strategy is essential for winning. The game supports online matching as well as local multiplayer gaming. Letteral currently supports five languages – English, Spanish, German, French, and Danish – but more are to be added in the future.


Additionally, i started publishing a series of *Lessons Learned* articles on Letteral. I learned so much from people, who are sharing their experiences with iOS development so I want to give something back now. In the first article, I talk about the basic idea for the game and about game design. A new article will go up every Friday, they will cover topics like *Monetization, GameCenter, Marketing, the App Store* etc. You can find the blog here:

IndieGaming,"Hi!

I've recently taken over production for the twitch show attached to a game design and animation program, and i want to start doing mini-series on specific aspects of game design and I'd love y'all's input!

The two revolving series that I have in mind are Kiss My Asset , where we teach you how to build specific assets from the ground up, with a new asset each month, and Game Design 101, which would be geared towards absolute beginning game designers. Each ""series"" will have 4 to 5, 90-minute episodes, each picking up where the last one left off. They'd have live interaction with the audience, with content being dictated by how far we, as a group (hosts and audience,) make it per episode.

SO, that being said, in your hivemind opinion, what are some of the most common issues people run into with asset building? Are there some types of assets known to be more difficult to nail than others? Where should Game Design 101 start? (Meaning, should it start at the LITERAL BEGINNING ""what is a game"" type stuff, or do you think it would be alright to move directly to something like brainstorming - paper prototyping - so on.)

I'm really excited for this series, and you'll see me popping in here (and the other game dev subreddits,) from time to time with questions and links, etc.

Thank you guys in advance!!

IndieGaming,"Hello all! Just wanted to give a heads up on a new RTS game now in production.

*Ascendancy* is a cross between a traditional, competitive RTS and a God Game where representatives of the major elemental gods battle for supremacy. Players will collect resources, build bases and produce element-based troops to be commanded. They will also have access to special Manifest (“godly”) Powers which can be used at any time the player wishes, providing they can afford to pay the resource cost for them. Players can also capture and command neutral super-creatures called Incarnates in addition to leveling up special Proxy hero characters. Coupling base expansions with fast action combat, the general goal is to destroy your enemy in a PvP setting. For the final release the focus will be on the four “primary” elements of Air, Earth, Fire and Water.

* Fast paced, competitive, tactical RTS. 
* Quick matches targeting about 20-30 minutes of play.
* Construct buildings, mine resources and produce troops.
* Progress through upgrades to increase your strength.
* Use your Powers tactically to buff troops, halt the enemy or smash them to bits!
* Expand your base to new locations and dominate the map.
* Choose from 4 different elemental races to crush all who oppose you (final release, 2 available during alpha/beta).
* A variety of troop types including various melee, ranged, scout/spy, flying, healing, AoE, siege, fast attack and carrier units.
* Hero type troops called a ""Proxy"" that can be leveled up over time, which will unlock new Proxy abilities or enhance previous ones.
* Capture and command neutral super-creatures or steal them away from your enemy to control for yourself.
* Seize buildings from opposing players and convert them for your use.
* Multiple match victory types such as destruction, king of the hill, capture the flag, kill/damage ratio and more!
* Leader boards tracking a variety of metrics, fight for the top spot in all categories!

IndieGaming,"Hello there! I'm one of three members of Broguelike, a modest but hopeful indie team based out of Houston, Texas. Our first title, PATHOS, was just released on Steam today after two years of development, and we're spreading the word to as many indie-loving gamers as we can. As anyone who has made a game knows, getting attention is the tough part, especially when it's a labor of love like PATHOS is for us. It's available now for $6.29 (10 percent discount) on Steam for PC.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
What is PATHOS?

A fine puzzle game is tricky to make. Ideally, it is difficult enough to challenge everyone without defeating anyone outright. Striking that balance takes careful design. We believe PATHOS delivers on that design, with a difficulty curve that rises very gradually and teaches the advanced techniques by forcing the player to perform them. Eventually, even the most hardened, most logical, most dogged puzzler is going to meet fierce resistance in PATHOS.

Every level (and there's more than 150 of them) is meticulously crafted. The designer on our crew, keeper of a beautiful mind, has spun these levels, anticipating how people will scaffold new information on top of old. In this way (and we know how ridiculous this comparison is) it's a bit like The Witness. With tactics and mechanics that emerge instead of being drilled. 

On top of gobs of puzzle content, there's a fully fleshed out narrative threaded throughout the entire game. It's a bit of heavy reading, but is entirely optional. Just another morsel to perhaps open the mind in a different way. The soundtrack is a masterful mix of groove and atmospheric, produced by virtuoso Tim Halbert. 

There's also a ton of mega tough achievements and secrets that are made for the real obsessives out there. I really want to meet the person who 100 percents PATHOS, because they probably work at NASA. I've always wanted to visit NASA.

HOWEVER

We cannot pay anyone as of yet. Royalties will obviously be distributed, but being that we are a group of poor college kids who honestly have little experience, we simply cannot pay anyone compensation unless something crazy happened and we hit it big time straight out of the gate, which, let’s face it, doesn’t happen.

IndieGaming,"Its called ""Reawakened""

The Story: It takes place around 20 years from now. Humanity has been enslaved by aliens in the most interesting way: they remove a humans (for lack of a better term) ""soul"" and use technology to mold it into a form that can work a certain job. why? well, its easier to control and does not need food or water to stay active. however, there is a phenomena known as ""Reawakening"" which causes one of these ""soulborgs"" to remember everything about their past life, with their former consciousness springing into being once again. this can occur at nearly any time. it causes the ""soulborg"" to assume a different form that is a simplistic representation of their mind, with abilities and sub-abilities. movement is fully though based. if you THINK your arm moves, it does. you control a mining droid who just reawakened. you end up encountering a rebellion made of reawakened soulborgs. you end up meeting and working with all sorts of characters, while attempting to find your little brother. 

Characters:

Elivia: The Protagonist. Incredibly protective of her little brother, mostly due to him being the only family she has left. often very stoic and has no sense of humor. surprisingly, via flashbacks, its revealed that she was a relaxed and funny person. its just, being reawakened dulls your emotions for a year or two. also, she is REALLY scared for her brothers well being, and has no time for humor in that case. when she DOES find him, she does loosen up quite a bit. her ability is ""liquid shapeshifting"" allowing her to cause certain body parts to become more fluid like, going from solid to rubber like to liquid. the sub ability? if she knows every single bit of information about an object, she can replicate it. example. if she knew everything this computer was made of, she could turn parts of herself into a glowing blue replica. she glows blue and is made mostly of circles and ovals

Tobi: Elivias little brother. scared as hell and somewhere on that giant, heart of gold looking spaceships. also absurdly cute. he is very timid, and yet eventually near the end of the game uses his newfound abilities to rip through an entire enemy force and save the mentally exhausted Elivia.

Talia: Elivias best friend when they were still human. kinda a foil. very sarcastic, often loudmouthed, and strong as hell. her ability is to separate herself into many many pieces, allowing her to shapeshift like iron mans MK 51. her sub ability... shes just REALLY REALLY strong. glows red and is made of triangles.

Leon: ultra hammy. thats who he is. despite this, he makes all these hamtastic jokes because hes scared. if you fight him... may god help you. because gravity is his power. SO. MUCH. GRAVITY. he glows pink and is made of heart shapes. overall, he's kinda the papyro of the bunch.

Bob: this guy... just... weird does not even describe him. he actually thinks that hes a ghost and thinks hes the scariest thing in the universe. often shouts randomly and makes bizarre non-sequitur a fucking language. his power? he can rotate his limbs freely and move on LITERATELY ANY SURFACE (even fluid). he glows orange and is made of squares.

Agatha: the goth girl. often depressed and pessimistic, and is REALLY short. often reads edgy poetry out of sheer audacity. really, she just wants attention. because no one ever did pay that much to her. her ability is to turn into a cloud of gas, therefore she can move through walls and stuff. she can also possess machinery. she somehow glows black and is made of out of hexagons. 

Luna: the sixth ranger here. a reformed alien who joins your side out of a realization that ""hey, maybe my job is not as important as PEOPLE'S SUFFERING"" did I mention that the aliens are just doing their jobs? yeah, their ""empire"" is the equivalent of a task force to the sheer size of the true empire. she has a lot of issues with more humane customs, and this is mostly played for laughs, like her inability to understand the human language, but she is somehow able to speak it. like most aliens, she can shapeshift and possesses IMMENSE psychic powers, to the point where she can create tiny nuclear explosions by telekineticly splitting atoms. she glows gray and is made of teardrop shapes.

doing the rest of the characters would spoil the rest of the game and take WAYYY too long.

Gameplay: metroidvaina style gameplay with a heavy focus on exploration. enemies are VERY hard to take down, and although theres no ammo limit, there is one to your patience. you need to be careful and time your button presses, because all of the enemies are lightning bruisers on steroids with immense reaction time. but so are you. all of your foes are as strong as you. the bosses are even stronger. you can pick up upgrades and blueprints around the massive map to heighten your abilities and aid in solving puzzles. the more you finish the game, the better the ending you get. as in its longer.

I don't love games with a steep learning curve complicated mechanics, or grinding. I just like to get into the action and immediately enjoy a game for what it is. Controller support + great art directions are bonuses.

IndieGaming,"Hello!

My team and I have been developping a dark RPG for almost a year now. The main theme is ""sins &amp; virtues"". Indeed, despite the main inspiration source are Pokemon and Final Fantasy, Unleashed is located in a more mature and violent world. Let me split the topic into smaller parts.

**The project**

* Our game is, as I said, a RPG based on some well known mechanics, such as turn based battles, open world exploration (with over 300 maps across 8 biomes), and a dramatic script.

* What we first tried to do was to put effort on interactions. Indeed, you can gather or interact with almost anything that surrounds you. You could get resources to buy, sell, or craft items that could even be used to decorate your house. Job levels allow you to gather more efficiently some materials, and can also allow you to get rarer materials.

* By repairing structures in cities, you can get a house that you can decorate as you want, knowing that some items are not just used for decorative purposes, but also for something else such as healing, growing plants etc.

* Regarding fights, to explain things quickly, you'll have the possibility to have up to 10 creatures, each having up to 2 different types (14 types in total, counting 7 sins and 7 virtues). Battles imply 3 creatures at once, so you'll have to use strategy to optimize your team and use attacks that work well together. Creatures can be improved by leveling up, using boosters, or even with ""assimilation"" (which won't be explained here).

**What about the current state of the game ?**

We have worked a lot on the game mechanics, meaning that the game IS playable. However, we have just started the scenario implementation, meaning that there's currently no public version available. However we've just released a trailer, that you can see here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNZ_Sm9qOM

Of course there are also pictures and news that you can see on Facebook/Twitter, which I invite you to visit, so that we know how much people are interested in this project. This means a lot to us, since getting more likes can be motivating as well as informative. Here are the links that will allow you to follow us:

To Eat Love is an arcade-style casual game for android devices. The goal of the game is to make it home safe, crashing as little as possible, trying to keep some of your money. It consists of sets of two stages, in the first of which you have to catch food and items falling from the top, in the second you drive home avoiding obstacles. The food that you catch in the first will give you boosts, which can be used in the second stage, either to accelerate, or to brake to avoid obstacles. The other items will affect your psyque, which will make the driving a bit harder, but will also give you money, which you will lose certain amount if you crash in the second stage, and the amount depends on what you crash with; crash with a shopping cart and you will lose much less than if you crash with a luxury car. When you lose all your money, then it's game over.

https://i.imgur.com/bW2JpOp.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/uofiVRh.jpg

At the eating stage, you control the mouth's horizontal movement by
touching the arrows at the bottom of the screen, and the goal is to catch as much stuff as possible. After some time you will drive home. The vehicle you will drive in depends on a couple of factors: If you play in arcade mode this depends on your overall score, that is, not counting the money you
lose at the driving scene. If you play history mode (the book icon) then you drive twice each vehicle until you run out and beat the game. Currently there are three vehicles.

The game lets you select between 4 languages (English, Spanish, German and French) although there isn't much text. It also lets you turn off the music, in case you'd rather play to your own soundtrack.

https://i.imgur.com/udp48qS.jpg

When you donwload the game you start off with 3 credits, you can get one more by watching a video, or by buying 100 credits.

Two more vehicles are planned (a humvee and a tank, just for fun!), and the addition of leaderboards and achievements.

   Hello guys, this is the game I'm developing at the moment. It's going to be a hard dungeon crawler, the game will feature a high amount of weapons and artefacts. The weapons will be tiered, like, tier 1 to tier 10, and after tier 10 the damage will be similar, but it will have different effects, these weapons will be called non tiered. The artefacts will give the char buffs, there will be tiers for artefacts, such as normal, rare and legendary, normal ones will give just status, rare may give some additional effects,  and the legendary ones will give game changing mechanics. 

   The game will feature about 60 different maps with unique monsters, items and bosses. The focus of the game is the boss fights and the intense / fast  combat.

   It would be great to get the feedback from you guys! 

   Thank you

IndieGaming,"**What is it?** 

Beyond the Veil is a text-based game about survival and mortality. It follows the physical and spiritual journey of 'The Driver' in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Fleeing a storm of immense magnitude, The Driver seeks to come to terms with the death of the love of his life, and his own death. Whether he survives long enough is up to the player.

Set over the course of 3 acts, Beyond The Veil is narrative heavy. Featuring an overarching story following The Driver himself, as well as shorter, individual stories for each of the supporting characters. I am aiming to include a Story and Survival mode, though the Survival mode may come after release, and Steam Achievements.

**What do you do?**

Players control The Driver, as well as a number of characters that may be encountered on the journey. In order to sate their thirst and hunger, as well as collect fuel to power your vehicle, you must explore the wastes around you. The wasteland is not empty, however, and there will be many who will want the few remaining resources for themselves. Beyond The Veil features a real-time combat system partly inspired by modern combat mechanics, as well as a gear system to encourage different approaches to gameplay both in and out of combat.

**Why text-based?** 

I find the genre fascinating, and I feel that it has fallen by the wayside in recent times. Traditional text-based games may not be suitable for modern audiences due to their dated implementation, but I feel that the genre has a lot to offer, and want to tackle it with an up-to-date mindset.

**Who am I?**

I graduated Computer Science last year, and have been making video games for 5 years. I've competed in 3 game jams, built prototypes and games of various sizes, and am now working as an Indie Dev full-time.

**Release Details**

I'm aiming to release Beyond The Veil this August. What you see now is the product of 4.5 months of work. I am in a good situation financially so I am able to dedicate myself to this project full time. I have a clear roadmap ahead, with all major systems in place. The remaining 6 months will be spent refining existing features, fixing bugs, generating content, and playtesting the game.

Initially I will be releasing on Steam, however since the game is built with controller support I am open to releasing on console if the demand is there.

I'd love to know what your thoughts on it are, and on the genre as a whole. I've included a couple of links for more information, as well as screenshots and videos, below.

IndieGaming,"Hey /r/IndieGaming I'm looking for a game that I only have a vague memory of a trailer. I believe it was multiplatform or more likely going to be released for the Switch (I mostly check that subreddit)

**What I remember from the trailer:
**
The opening cinematic is a team of people moving to the right of the screen. There is desert scenary. Perhaps a giant skeleton corpse? 

Later it shows your team (3-4 players) battling bosses. Part of me thinks it is isometric and part of me thinks it is pixel art (can't quite remember)

To end the trailer you hear a screech (I think) and then you see the shadow of a dragon flying ""north"" across the screen. 

I believe you then see the title. 

*I believe this game is supposed to release 2018, but I can't for the life of me remember the title. I think I kind of brushed it off because in summer 2017, 2018 seemed very far off.* 

1 last thing: I think this was revealed/released around the tokyo game show, but I am not 100% sure. 

Some titles that were suggested in my nintendoswitch post, which were incorrect:

~~Nine Parchments~~

~~Titan Quest~~

~~Battle Chasers Night War~~

~~Octopath Traveler~~

~~Dragon Marked for Death~~ 

~~Darkest Dungeon~~

(none of these even match the description I posted there, but whatever)

Hope someone out there knows what I'm talking about!

So a little more than a year ago I had to quit my job because my health got worse and I decided to start working on a game until I get better. The game is now finished, I also patched it twice since release.

Now I am looking for feedback &amp; testers for it, since it looks like the first time user experience needs tweaking &amp; also it is not getting the attention I would like!

The game is inspired by the arcade games of the 80's, while graphically and aesthetically inspired by the mid-90's PS1 era. You get in your trusted old ship, Krydor, to take on your nasty enemies and get your hands on their treasure. With your money you can upgrade your ship, buy abilities and thus progress further!

I have already got some valuable feedback on the game but I desperately need more, especially regarding the difficulty and general user experience. I know the game gets quite fun later on, the few people who have sunk some time in it get it, but I feel like the beginning might be lacking? Or maybe too difficult?

If you feel interested please do try it out and leave some feedback. If you feel like it could be your cup of tea, I am looking for 5-10 testers who could provide me feedback on, say, a weekly basis, and could play it for a few minutes everyday and help me with their feedback! Developers, casual gamers, hardcore gamers, everyone is welcome and appreciated!

IndieGaming,"I run Indie Game News series where I report on latest findings from world of indie gaming particularly from Base Building and Tycoon genres. This month I collected information on 7 base building titles here is some news. Would there be an interest in my making this a monthly post?

Atomic Society
----------------

After 4 months of work Atomic Society version 0.0.8 has been released this version will feature 2 new maps: Valley and Summit, new apartment tower building, new toleration solution.

We  will see new Scavenger focus feature, improvements to building placement and many graphical improvements as well as dozens of bug fixes and optimizations. 

Atomic Society is a post-apocalyptic town building game where you set all the laws and morals of society. Your job is to overcome the challenges of creating a town that can sustain a growing population. You will have to maintain law and order in the wasteland. You will face disease and starvation as well as many social challenges. 

For now game is available only from developer website. 

Astroneer
-----------

Astroneer have seen new research update. Developers at System Era have finally woke up to the fact that game base will die without further updates and it’s time to show something of value to keep users in. 

This update introduces complete overhaul of research system. This change was necessary to allow developers to add new items to the game on more consistent basis.

New system introduces concept of Bytes. Players will have to research items at new Research Chamber. Players will have to provide research chamber with enough materials to generate bytes that can can be used to purchase new blueprints. From what I see in here it’s a system very similar to subnautica solution of scanning environment and searching for wreckage, hopefully it will balance grind and exploration well but only time will tell. Research chamber will require constant flow of energy so ensuring your base is well equipped will be more essential than ever. 

In addition to research changes we will see new resource colours to better reflect actual colour of resources in real world. We will see few UI tweaks and addition of new in game tutorial to introduce new players to the game. 

Important change that may not make everyone happy is automatic crash reporting game will automatically send crash reports when it crashes due to the bug, most players will be fine with it but some of folks who particularly value they privacy will probably be not impressed with such solution. Apart of that as always bug fixes and improvements. 

Factorio 
---------

One of the best rated games in history of steam Factorio released version 0.16 already complex base builder adds even more features. We will see addition of buffer chests, artillery wagons as if factorio trains weren’t awesome enough already and finally cliffs impossible land barriers that you will have to build your base around or use for better defences from biters. 

Game will introduce beter train visualisation, train schedules and wait conditions can now be rearranged by drag and drop, new mini tutorial, ability to filter player inventory and new terrains and many many more minor features, bug fixes and optimizations.

Factorio is a 2nd best rated game on steam ever, currently on 98% positive rating out nearly 25 000 reviews submitted , just couple on steps behind Portal 2.

StarMade 
----------

StarMade entered verion 200.250 which is pre-build of the game. After  over 3 years of early access developers believe that they have almost completed build of the game that needs just so final testing and fine tuning. 
There is a lot of changes to the game so let’s focus on the most important one in my opinion but I encourage you to check video description for links to the website. 

We will see new options for HUD display allowing you to get as much or as little information as you want, we will see new module use system that is faster and more stable to what players had experience so far. 

Developers have added new power, effects and chamber systems and fixed several memory leaks and virtual RAM problems. We are introduced to new shield system and recon vs stealth system as well as reworked overheating conditions. Game is currently sat on 72% positive review on steam and is on the fast tract to leave Early access very soon. 

Time for recent releases.

Stationeers 
---------

Stationeers entered early access on 12th of December last year. 

Stationeers puts you in control of the construction and management of a space station either by yourself in single player, or online multiplayer with your friends. Inspired by Space Station 13, complex atmospheric, electrical, manufacturing, medical, agriculture, and gravitational systems require your thought and management at all times.

Stationeers is designed for hardcore players who want a game that is systems oriented. Full utilization and optimization of these complex systems will only come from great knowledge and practice. The game presents a variety of science-based survival problems that you must address. Resource and time pressures will drive your initial designs, but the demands of a thriving station will guide you later.

Game offers:

Detailed construction system that rewards well-designed architectural, atmospheric, and electrical plans. Those systems include temperature, pressure, combustion, gas mixtures, water, and fire.

Full physics on dynamic items in the world, including atmospheric effects such as wall fatigue, and explosive decompression. Various dangerous environments to explore and develop including exotic planets, and asteroid belts. Players will have ability to mine asteroids, keep a life stock, construct complex factories using machines, conveyor belts and computers. 
Game is build with multithreading at its core to support multiplayer and scalability. 

Stationeers is currently rated at 86% positive review score out of over 500 reviews submitted. 
Time for announcements.

Neolithic
---------

Neolithic  has been successfully funded on kickstarter ensuring its future development. 

Neolithic: First City-States is a Deep Historical Strategy Game heavily influenced by games such as Age of Empires I, Civilization &amp; Caesar III.
 
The game includes aspects of city building, military strategy and deep character development. The game is about making this micro and macro scale gameplay meet in a meaningful way.
 
Set in the Neolithic or Chalcolithic to Late Bronze Age, the game features characters that have needs, gain skills, carry, equip and craft items, build structures and each have unique strengths and weaknesses.
 
Game promises to focus on character development and making each citizen stand out, losing people on combat will have a real effect and may take time to replenish and train again. 
 
Game is planned to release on steam in July this year. 

Foundation
------------

Our final announcement comes from Foundation. Foundation is the Settlers inspired city builder. You are the Lord of the Village! Your job is to build your city, grow your wealth and the economy, and lead your vassals while facing the challenges dealing with the intrigue of the King and Court, the machinations of the Ecclesiastical Estate and the unpredictable behaviors of the highwaymen.

Few unique features of the game you may be interested in: 
You have total freedom to build where you want since buildings will adapt to the topography they are built on. You can freely build uphill, on top of a mountain, on a cliff or at a waters edge.

You will help to determine where roads are traced from the walking trails of the villagers and carts. Roads will tend to weave around hills as they go uphill. Observe as popular roads widen and become major highways and unfrequented ones will disappears over time.

You will be able to divide your land in shapes you want by using the paint tool to create different types of zoning like agricultural, residential, military, religious, commercial, and resources extraction such quarries, hunting reserves, and lumber lots.

At the moment no dates are yet available as far as I am aware but I will keep a close eye on this title.

IndieGaming,"Hi folks last month I got some good reception from you so here is this month news from Tycoon and Business Management genres in the comment section you will find links to all covered games for the lazy. 

Transcript
-----------

As always we start this month news with recent releases.

Railway Empire released on steam on 26th of January and so far has received 81% positive reception out of nearly 500 reviews submitted.

In Railway Empire, you will create an elaborate and wide-ranging rail network, purchase over 40 different trains modelled in extraordinary detail, and buy or build railway stations, maintenance buildings, factories and tourist attractions to keep your travel network ahead of the competition. You’ll also need to hire and manage your workforce if you want to ensure an efficient train service, whilst also develop over 300 technologies ranging from mechanical improvements to the trains themselves to workplace infrastructures and advanced amenities as you progress through five eras of technological innovations. To get to the top you may have to resort to more cutthroat tactics as you attack and sabotage your opponents through raids and industrial espionage.

Time for updates of already existing games

The Production Line has released few new updates this past month with most notable one being addition of scenarios. Players will now be able to choose between regular game that they are used to, freeplay (no financial worries or competition) and also scenarios with fixed targets and timelines.

We will see some new features: Fit dashboard is now researchable to be split into fit controls and fit cabin. Market sales matrix tips now take into account current stock in the showroom. Additionally as always GUI improvements, balance changes and optimizations.

Rise of Industry is moving to Steam Early Access. Developers decided it’s time to move to bigger platform and feel game is ready for release on steam.

Rise of Industry is a strategic tycoon game that puts you in the shoes of an early 20th-century industrialist. Build and manage your growing empire in a living, breathing, and procedurally generated world that is constantly evolving and adapting to your playstyle. 

As a budding entrepreneur, you will build factories, construct efficient transport lines, move raw materials, produce finished goods, and arrange trade with the world's developing cities, providing them with the resources they need to flourish - for as they grow and prosper, so do you.

The one good thing about this move is the fact that developers are backed by Kasedo Games Publisher so there is a smaller risk involved in case Early Access sales don’t go as well as planned. As always keep an eye but stay cautious.

Now time for a most exciting news of this month Two Point Hospital successor to legendary Theme Hospital has been announced to come out this year. Game is being developed by original Theme Hospital crew and aims for the same comedic value and hilarious gameplay.

As you can expect your job will be about designing and managing hospital, dealing with staff their needs and personalities as well as responding to their demands. 

You will need to ensure your patients are well treated, diseases cured and hospital clean while roughlessly cutting cost where you can get away with it. Game will feature multiplayer option via collaborative research programs and competitive mode. 

I will report as soon as we have any more details. 

Sky Haven another airport simulator game has been announced to come this year. Sky Haven is airport tycoon game in which you plan and construct your airport, you will have to manage and schedule flights schedule, complete research and improve logistic. 

I am bringing it to your attention for two reasons first and foremost more competition is good and it may push Airport CEO and SimAirport to become better games and also because unlike those games it is planned to be finished product. 

On the other hand I want you to watch trailer carefully and notice how many things appear to be missing to compare to those titles. Watch this game but don’t get overly optimistic. 

Train Valley 2 has been announced to come out in a first quarter of this year. Train Valley is a combination of puzzle and tycoon game in which, you aim to drive forward the industrial revolution. Your job is to build an efficient railway, upgrade your locomotives, and keep trains on track without delays to meet the ever-growing demand of the cities and industries in your tiny valley.

Players will be able to Upgrade their stock of locomotives and unlock advanced engines as you play, with 18 locomotives and over 35 types of train cars from 6 generations in total.

Developers aim to make the game moddable and players will be able to add their own wagons and train engines to the game and share with other players. 

Final announcement of this month Rec Center Tycoon developer is pushing Early access release towards beginning of the summer. With plan to Leave Early access toward the end of a year beginning of 2019. Currently works are in place to implement more feature before the build is ready for the public hence this short deley. 

Rec Center Tycoon draws inspiration from the management classics like Theme Hospital to give you a deep business management game where you build and run a recreation center from the ground up. Micromanage employees, finances, fitness classes, customer needs and much more!
Game will feature both Career &amp; Sandbox modes
Large selection of buyable exercise equipment (over 100 planned for release!)

Many different types of employees, from your simple receptionist to a boxing trainer with every employee having different motivations &amp; skill levels

For detail obsessed players there will be option to design your own staff uniforms and create your own fitness classes
Game promises complex financial system.and ability to organise fitness tournaments.

IndieGaming,"Hey Indie gaming fans! &lt;3                        EDIT: It's a pc game, and probably PC-exclusive

Here's the deal. A few years ago I played this indie game which was a lot like minecraft. It had block destroying-building elements, it was a shooter game, it had wayy better graphics than minecraft but it was still blocky. It featured a simple client (in dark colors i believe, black/grey) which allowed you to browse servers.

I looked all over internet, used many different keywords while searching google/gaming blogs/minecraft blogs/youtube etc.
I couldn't find it, which is probably not surprising considering it had like only a couple hundred concurrent players at best.

I think there were multiple game modes, but I only played the team-deathmatch type one. 

There were 2 teams (i believe labeled blue and red, not sure).
Upon joining you would be provided with an overlay to choose your weapon. The following were available:

- an M1 garand type semi-auto rifle. Probably labeled 'rifle'.
- MP5 type gun labeled 'submachine gun'
- I believe there was a 'shotgun' too.
- I think grenades existed as well. 

You could destroy blocks with a shovel and then later rebuild using those blocks, creating mini cover around the battlefield. The maps were pretty big, it would take a bit of time to reach the frontline/chokepoints from spawn, a lot like a Battlefield map.

The game in question is **not** 'ace of spades', but i find that ace of spades is the closest thing to it i could find online. 

I believe the game's name was a single word title, not multiple words, but i cannot be 100% certain. 

Please, if anyone has any idea what the game's name is help me out, I really wanna play it bad. It might be dead by now, but 2-3 years ago it had enough players for several full servers.","Looking for the name of an indie Minecraft-like shooter game, please help me!"
IndieGaming,"For the young'uns here, Chu Chu Rocket is a 4p single-screen multiplayer game for the Sega Dreamcast, released in 1999, in which players need two directional systems: one to move a pointer around an arena, and one to lay down directional arrows (up/down/left/right) onto the arena's floor. The object is to lay down arrows that redirect a bunch of innocent mice into your base, while redirecting harmful cats into OTHER players' bases. Mice increase your score; cats decrease it.

(More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChuChu_Rocket! ... it was the first SegaNet game, and original Sonic series programmer Yuji Naka directed it. Its original Japanese commercial is awesome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga62uiXbEjI)

Sega put out a crappy smartphone port a zillion years ago with no multiplayer support (the game ships with a fine-enough puzzle mode). I'd KILL for a version that I could just install on my gaming PC and play with friends on a given party night. Wholesale ripoff, thoughtful spiritual successor, whatever. I know someone put out a puzzle-only version called Pig Pig Rocket, but I'm more interested in the same-screen multiplayer mode (since it recalls a lot of the greatness of series like Bomberman).

If anybody wants me to, like, do some writing or drawing or general messing-around on a project of it, lmk. I'm not a game designer in the slightest; I just troll this subreddit in search of interesting games. I just hope this inspires someone to bring me great local-multiplayer joy. Cheers.","has anybody made a spiritual successor to Chu Chu Rocket? if not, please?"

To Eat Love is a new Android game. It's supposed to be about driving, but it also features a catching/eating scene. In this scene you are a mouth catching hearts, clouds, and some more ridiculous stuff, and also some food, like hot-dogs, hamburgers and tacos. Whatever you eat in this stage, will have an affect on the driving scene, this way, you might hallucinate, 
the streets can get blurry, or the cars and other objects will swing from side to side. Your objective is to get home. The white bar on the right side of the screen serves as an indicator of how much is left for you to make it home. Eating crazy stuff will get you money, which serves the purpose of a health bar, when you crash while driving, you will lose money, depending on what you crash with. The food serves as either speed-ups, or brakes, which you can use to escape crashes. Getting a hold of the gas and brake is paramount to make it to the end of the game in history mode, or to reach a high score. At the top of the screen there are indicators of the money you have, the food items (which indicate how many times you can either accelerate or brake) and the score. The score on the lower part of the screen is the high score, or the previous high score if you've already beat it. You will start off with 3 credits, and to get more you can watch a video ad; it'll get you 2 more credits, unless you want to pay for 100 credits.

The game has both arcade mode and some kind of history mode. Both are similar, but in history mode you work to beat the game, and not just to beat the high score. In history mode you need to beat the driving level 6 times, 2 times with a compact car, 2 times in a motorcycle, and 2 times in a red Lamborghini. The compact car will be slow and steady, while the motorcycle is faster, but also smaller, so it is easier to avoid obstacles. The red Lamborghini is another story, it accelerates too fast, and it's size makes it difficult to avoid obstacles. I recommend saving your brakes and gas for this stage. Also the more you progress in the game, the more affected your psyque will be. If you beat the game in history mode you will be treated to the credits (very few lines) and a song, with voice and all. 

The graphics are below average, where everything besides maybe the mouth seem lifeless. This could be a nice break from all the games with over-vivid characters. At the driving scene there is a cyclist that gets run over leaving what I would call a bloody mess, except that the blood is black (censored), so it might as well be oil spilled by the vehicles. 

The controls are responsive, even though I've always struggled when playing with touch controls.  All you need is a little bit of practice to beat the game. 

The game features 4 languages, English, Spanish, German and French, although there isn't much text to show. Also, if you don't like the music, there is an option to turn it off, leaving only the sound effects. I recommend using this option and listening to your own playlist. 

In history mode, the game starts easy enough so you can grasp the controls, but soon as the vehicle changes to the motorcycle, things get real.

IndieGaming,"Hi Redditors, as an indie studio, we developed a free game based on user-generated contents, a Mario Maker like with a visual coding interface to go further in the creation.

Today, we are thinking about publishing the best creations as a new premium game. Since the content is created by players, it seems normal to share the game revenues with creators. Has a studio already done something like that? We love the idea of a game created by its own community, and love also the fact that a 20 year old very talented player could actually earn money from playing. 

We really want to do this to highlight the talent of young players that contribute to the content diversity we have in our game. How do you think this could go?

IndieGaming,"I finally finished playing inside. I bought it almost when it came up because I liked the art style. To me the art-style is still its biggest asset. It looks
stunning, dark and beautiful. I love that art-style, and the sound design does its part in keeping you immersed in this eerie world. The character is likable, even though it doesn't have a face, or maybe in part because of this. In general the game is great, and of the right length for the price. Of course I would have liked it to be longer, and maybe someday Playdead will release a 10+ hours game of the same style and quality. 

Now, what I didn't like, personally, is that the story made no sense to me. I get it that they tried to make it obscure, but at the end  it was getting pretentious. The final game mechanics are O.K., but I think they were unnecessary. If all the final stages were made to introduce this new
mechanics, I found them excessive. I was enjoying the journey, until I was left confused by the turn of events and the conclusion.

IndieGaming,"Hello lovely people,

I recently had the pleasure of playing Fossil Hunters, a new puzzle/exploration game out on Steam later today (13 Feb).

I've put together a short video (4 and a half minutes) just looking at the very basics of the game, such as number of players, the objectives, gameplay, that sort of thing.

To summarise, Fossil Hunters is a beautifully presented puzzle game about digging through tiles in each level to discover dinosaur fossils, which you then drag around to piece together to make complete skeletons. The bigger the skeleton, the greater the reward! But there's risk involved in ledges, rockfalls and little 6-legged monster creatures.

There's also a storyline involved which is carried forward by the collection of scrolls, which complete your journal to tell the tale of missing Fossil Hunters who have got lost in the caves.

Abyss Crew is a co-op exploration videogame aboard a submarine, set in a steampunk universe. A Kickstarter campaign has just started and is going well, it has been selected as a ""Project we love"" from Kickstarter:
[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/98046098/abyss-crew-a-coop-submarine-game]

Abyss Crew is an underwater cooperative roguelike game that allows 1 to 4 players to take on the roles of the Pilot, the Sonar Operator, the Gunner, and the Engineer, on a local or online network.

Stay sharp, keep a level head, coordinate with your crewmates, and make life-saving decisions in the dark depths of an unforgiving ocean!

[Pilot Station](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20180126_Screenshot_Pilot.png)

The pilot controls multiple engines and guides the submarine through the cavernous waters of the Abyss. During battle, the Pilot must maneuver evasively and communicate with the Gunner to coordinate torpedo firing vectors. Visibility is limited and danger is everywhere, but listen carefully to your Sonar Operator and you’ll keep everyone in one piece.
[The pilot in action here](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/eye2.gif)

[Sonar Station](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20180122_Radio.png)

The Sonar Operator is the submarine’s eyes and ears in the treacherous darkness of the Abyss. He can scan the environment for threats, mark points of interest, and set waypoints. During battle, the Sonar Operator can reveal the weaknesses and track the movement of hostiles, providing life-saving information to the Gunner.
[The Sonar in action here](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sonar.gif)

[Gunner Station](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20180126_Screenshot_Gunner.png)

The Gunner uses a fearsome array of torpedoes, mines, and flechettes to defend the submarine from pirate vessels and hostile creatures. The Gunner can also illuminate the surround area with flares and destroy debris. Or launch a harpoon against a stray Kraken… 
[The gunner in action here](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gunner2.gif)

[Engineer Station](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20180122_Engineer.png)

The Engineer processes the valuable orichalcum crystals the crew has gathered. Refined orichalcum can be used to repair the sub, to upgrade modules, or to create more powerful torpedoes. Just remember to refine and stockpile enough orichalcum to turn a profit!
[The engineer in action here](http://www.abysscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/captainModules.gif)

As the creator of the game, I designed these role to encourage interactions between players: you'll have to evaluate tactical situations, to communicate efficiently, and to rely on your crewmates. This help to create a deep, immersive experience within the game, confering a unique comradery building experience in the depths of the ocean! Some of the games that inspired its creation are Faster Than Light, Sunless Sea, and Artemis: a melting pot of some of our favorites, with some unique twists!

IndieGaming,"Sometimes a minimal story works out really well. 

I think people can genuinely enjoy filling in the gaps of the story when the game doesn't take itself seriously. Take this this video for [Soda Drinker Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-XYr9ssvj4) for example. 

When games have a more serious tone, and skimp on the story I feel a little bit cheated. Getting lost in someone else's world and not getting the expected payoff of a good story can dampen the whole experience for me. 

I don't have experience with the game myself, but I have been hearing a lot of buzz around the lack of story in Destiny despite the attempts at the gameplay and atmosphere trying to get you to really care.

What are your thoughts?

",What makes games with little to no story good/bad?
IndieGaming,"As with all new titles, I approached this game with only the most rudimentary understanding of what it was – I don’t want to begin forming opinions until I’ve had the chance to try things first-hand.

I’m now [**halfway into the game**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWTxRITKTSQ) and am thus far unimpressed (you can find the first part [**here**]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsIyIjxeyAY)).

**A game or an art piece?**

James Beech, creator and former Crytek employee, has marketed the game as:

&gt;[[…] as a work of Art unique to this medium. […] I wanted to play up the aspects of an interactive, virtual environment in relation to story-telling.](http://visit-ultraworld.com/about-the-game/)

Unfortunately, in focussing on the ‘art’, James appears to have completely neglected the ‘story-telling’ aspect. Even the art isn’t that extraordinary: a series of basic shapes with flat primary colours, plus a few lighting effect options tagged on as rewards for progression but which serve zero purpose in the game itself.

**Narrative? What narrative?**

Far more disappointing than the visuals is the total lack of narrative depth. As you’ll see from the video, an AI NPC repeatedly poses the same series of solipsistic and existential questions: *‘what is true?’ ‘what is my purpose?’* 

Unfortunately, now about an hour into a two-hour game, these questions are yet to be developed or answered in any way.

I put this to James, who responded:

&gt; Without revealing the themes/intent of the piece, I will say that the ""lack of philosophical depth"" is quite intentional. […] Simplicity and timelessness were both goals I kept in mind for all aspects of production […] I was aiming for just the right amount of depth to get the overall points across without distracting from them.

I’ll let you make up your own minds, but of what I’ve played so far, this is yet to earn the [£10/$15 asking price](https://sites.fastspring.com/neonserpent/instant/ultraworld).",ULTRAWORLD: a case of art before gameplay?

IndieGaming,"Hi folks,

We figured that we finally have got enough to show of our upcoming game **Stunt Rush**, so we quickly shot this teaser. Please check it out!

**[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wfGpXjeIs&amp;feature=youtu.be)**

**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dustyroomgames)**

***

**Stunt Rush is a mobile racing platformer** created by two people standing behind Dustyroom studio. We have been working on it for about four month full-time now and plan to release it in about a month on Android and iOS. More platforms may follow. 

***

This is our first project in Unity and the first 3D game overall. We use Asset Store a lot. Some of the best assets we found there are Curvy and NGUI - check them out if you haven't. All levels and vehicles were hand-crafted in Blender.



The biggest challenge was to develop a proper collision detection system. It was tricky to make a car turn smoothly without hitting every obstacle on its way. The solution here is to have special colliders on sides of the car with zero friction in X and Z directions and full friction in Y direction. This way the car will not climb onto obstacles and just stay on the road.

***

We also work hard on sound design. The track in the video above is OC from the game. By the way, @polygrim (artist) *would love to work on music for your indie game*! Feel free to check his stuff out

IndieGaming,"I've had more of a chance to play around with the games mechanics lately, and today I added a few extras to the boost. Whereas before there was the simple 'press triggers to boost' you can now hold them down and charge an even bigger boost, at the cost of control and being unable to boost while charging.

I also added a quick feature that boosts you slightly when you change direction quickly. Its subtle, but super handy.

This is the first proper video we've put out, only 30 seconds long though!

**Why God Why?**

So, a few months ago, we were working on a one-button-bird-eating-man-shitting-game ([screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5419498/EatMeScreen.png)). As usual, we were bloating the crap out of it with useless features and what not, and a month into development, when we realized that we weren’t creating the small, simple &amp; fun game we set out to, we decided to pause developement. Rather than just grinding on, we decided to keep the mechanic we liked the most and and scrap the rest. We re-evaluated the setting, and chose to go super minimalist with 3 colors and only squares. While this kind of aesthetic has been kinda overused lately, I must say, it was awesome to work with. It allowed us to focus on what really mattered, the gameplay.  

----  
**Gameplay**

The gameplay is all about jumping, avoiding and predicting your way through 99 devious levels. We spent a lot of time trying to hit the sweet spot between challenge and AARGHH, and while levels are punishing, progress is saved! 

Let us know what you think! We are currently pondering making a new version where we can bloat the game as we usually do. If you have any suggestions for good bloating material, or stuff you think we should fix in a new version, we would love to hear your opinion!",[SP-Game] 99 Problems!

We do have plans to release on Windows phones as well.

[Gameplay!](http://youtu.be/CeDxL77aQTo)

  Tubby Tabby is a simple arcade game designed to play like minigolf.  The objective is to fling your fat cat through different rooms to catch a mouse.  We use a top down perspective in order to give the player the best control of the cat, but utilize all 3D assets and environments to give the game a little bit of depth.  We recently added some cat skins, as well as a few new levels.  If all goes well we would like to add more content (levels, and themed cat skins for holidays).

  We are a small dev team who has spent the last few months creating 3D assets, animations, sounds, fonts, and code in order to get this game to work.  We wanted to make a game that was fun to play, simple, and nice to look at.  

  I am one of the 3D Modelers, Texture artist, Lead Animator, Lead Sound Design, Publishing....I think that about covers it.  We all had a hand in every part of this project so its difficult to take credit for any one thing.  If anyone has any questions about the process we took, or the roadblocks we ran in to, I would be more than happy to answer any questions.  

Thank you for your time Redditors, promo codes are below.  If you use one, please rate and review.  We could certainly use your help.

IndieGaming,"[**Neverending Nightmares is a Kickstarter-funded psychological horror game inspired by its lead developer’s own struggles with OCD and depression.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOoKhinZjPw)

**Visuals**

I really enjoyed these – certainly they made a refreshing change from the pixel art that’s been popping up everywhere of late.

The imagery is said to have been inspired by the work of the late Edward Gorey, and that definitely comes across. The monochrome environment really adds to the feeling of isolation and bleakness

**Gameplay**

The game plays a little like the Silent Hills preview, in that the vast majority of the game is spent traversing the same corridor and the rooms that come off it. The order of these appears to change from time to time, heightening a sense of disorientation and confusion and a feeling of no escape. 

Unfortunately, the pacing isn’t the best. There are stages in which you can spend a good five minutes slowly ambling along corridors with little if anything actually happening to progress the plot forward. Although the background score and sound effects help maintain some of the tension and foreboding, the uneventful and pedestrian nature of much of the game can pull you out of the grim atmosphere it’s tried hard to establish.

In addition, with a notable absence of interaction with characters or the environment, there’s precious little to do other than continue walking forward in the hope of triggering the next event.

**Is it worth £10.99?**

It’s certainly an interesting title, and I’ll persevere with it to the end (of which there are said to be three). However, having seen some people comment that it’s barely more than an hour’s worth of gameplay, it’s probably not worth the current asking price.

Wait until there’s a Steam sale before you give it a go – unless you’re feeling flush.

IndieGaming,"I'm looking for playtesters and reviewers for my game, Monster Mansion.

The objective is to escape. All players must make it out, or everyone loses.

The time is running out... The game includes a digital timer set for 10 minutes per player. The game will end when it runs out.

When your turn begins, first grab the ""Turn Dice"", then immediately draw a card from the ""Encounter Deck"". Monsters you find engage with you, and events affect you right away.

Then, for your ""Turn Action"", you can choose choose one of the following: move, attack, or heal.

The game map is made out of dynamic room-tiles which creates a unique dungeon for each game. If you choose to move, just place your character avatar into an adjacent room (also connected).

Players may attack monsters engaged with them, or another player in the room. The damage you deal is equal to your attack attribute.

Players may heal themselves or other players in the room. The damage you deal is equal to your healing attribute.

When your turn ends, all monsters engaged with you attack you, and that concludes your turn.

Since the clock will be ticking, players have to act fast! Luckily, there are plenty of ""Free Actions"" which players may perform at anytime, even if it's not their turn. Buying/selling items, trading with other players, and using one-time items are all ""Free Actions""!

The game is easy to learn, but hard to beat. Games with 2-3 players are fully cooperative, but when there are 4+ players there is a ""VIP"", and a hidden traitor called the ""Assassin"" added into the game. If the ""VIP"" dies, the game ends immediately and the ""Assassin"" wins! Basically, the good guys (""Civilians"") will be trying to protect the ""VIP"" and escape, meanwhile the hidden ""Assassin"" will be trying to figure out who is the ""VIP"" and stab him in his back...

That's the gist of the game. You can find out more at our [website](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chancegamer/monster-mansion).

Thanks for your time!

",Looking for Playtesters &amp; Reviewers for Monster Mansion: A REAL-TIME survival adventure.
IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 4 am EST, and stay up for an entire week. There is no account age limit for commenting in these posts, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. These posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

   Project title - title of the game, blog or article
   Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc
   Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project
   Links to the project - 
   Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.


As always [subreddit rules apply](/r/indiegaming/rules). And remember: top level comments *must* include self promotion. Have fun everyone!

I'm writing to let you know that our studio has just begun a Kickstarter campaign for our multiplayer tactical role-playing game, Immortal Empire.  It’s like a cross between X-Com, Diablo, and Dota set in a fantasy universe.

* Already **greenlit** on Steam.
* Users can **vote** on what stretch goals come next.
* One interesting stretch goal is to **release the game engine for free**, including all source code + tools we used to build Immortal Empire. (Without going into too much detail, it’s a game engine specifically built for 2D multiplayer games for Windows, Mac, and Linux, including browser support.)
* This campaign aims to turn our existing browser-game into a ‘real’ downloadable game. So you can **redeem your Kickstarter rewards immediately** in the browser game (and transfer your account to Steam later)

IndieGaming,"Hi,
I am here to talk about the Youtuber One F Jef today. He occupies a niche market on Youtube of playing small indie and 3rd party games (The kind you guys like). He is one of the best color commentators I have ever watched with his no holds barred style.

A while back Jef stopped posting videos. Many assumed he had quit or died. He lost a lot of subs because of this. It turns out Jef had become really sick and almost died and had also gone through the death of his father. He has now started posting again continuing to play his style of indie games and using his preforming abilities to bring happiness to people, because that is what his father would have wanted.

However, due to his prolonged absence and how small his market is he is struggling to support himself. The gaming community would do well to help out a struggling man who has given us many hours of joy. If you would like to get a taste of his style of commentary I would recommend either the old Liberal Crime Squad videos or the recent Cataclysm series.

IndieGaming,"**Summary**

[**If you enjoy slow-paced adventure games with little in the way of gameplay mechanics, this is the title for you.**](http://youtu.be/hh2F0PVmnbA)


**Visuals and audio**

I’m getting a little tired of the endless barrage of pixel-based titles, so the less said on the visuals the better.

I’ve seen a few people lauding the game’s soundtrack (which you can also purchase for a small fee), but I didn’t find it anything special. Take any lounge music track and slow it to half speed. Done. 


**Gameplay**

This is what lets the game down and sapped all my incentive to play. In the absence of a jump key or the ability to run, you’re left slowly scrolling from left to right along a completely linear path. In fact, even when moving up and down objects, the animations are painfully unhurried. Thankfully, in aside from the walking simulator elements, there are opportunities to interact with the environment. Unfortunately, these are primarily limited to two functions: chopping down grass that blocks your path, and breaking rocks that block your path.

The pace of the game is slow, and if that’s your bag, you’ll probably enjoy it. For me, I’d much prefer to run quickly by areas in which zero new gameplay is occurring, especially if backtracking previously explored areas.


**Narrative**

Unfortunately, the leisurely, repetitive and unengaging nature of the gameplay was such that I became bored and impatient before I had the opportunity to experience much of the narrative. 

Of the sections I did persevere with and play through, it looks as though the central storyline could progress somewhere interesting, pursuing the ability to connect with a spirit world.

Aside from the main narrative of the game, the dialogue with NPCs left much to be desired. The writers consciously attempted to write the NPC dialogue as humorous, but failed rather miserably and came across as trying far too hard in this respect. In fact, the strained ‘zany’ nature of the dialogue was such that I soon gave up bothering to talk to NPCs.

I really want to make the game as it's always been a passion of mine to make a game, but without a programmer i'm shit outta luck.

Any feedback/help greatly appreciated! :)

**EDIT:**

Thanks for showing so much interest guys, I uploaded my game mock-ups onto Imgur. I'm going to start tossing this around and see what people think.

LINK: http://imgur.com/a/Br9Ht

As you can see, it's a fairly basic game. Objective is to reach the finish line and not die. If you die, you restart level. If you run out of lives, you can either wait, or purchase more.

Think of this as a cross between 'super meat boy' and 'the impossible game'. Its a rage game, you will die a lot, and hopefully have some fun in the process :D

The ball rolls, meaning it spins clockwise as it moves; it doesn't just glide along.

Regarding game-play and physics (for the ball), thinking of 3 different options which are noted below.

* 1) Ball moves left to right at a constant speed, tap anywhere on screen to jump.

* 2) Ball moves left to right at a constant speed, however pressing on the left side of the screen will increase speed, and tapping on right side of screen will make you jump.

* 3) Everything said in #2, but with variable jump. Meaning, if you just 'tap' right side of screen, the ball jumps say 2 blocks vertically, however if you hold down instead of tap, your ball jumps higher.

Clearly it's not 100% put together, and no levels are designed, but you can see (i hope) the potential. I'm still missing (which i'll be creating this weekend) the 'Customize Ball' menu and 'Settings' menu and some other odds and ends.

The plan for designing levels is to get some sort of tile system setup to where levels can just be created by painting the blocks where you want them to go in an editor, kind of like [this software](http://www.mapeditor.org/)

In addition to creating all the assets, I'm working on animations to show a programmer certain elements such as: transitions between different menus, transitions between menu and gameplay, transition between beating a level and the next screen, how the ball jumps, etc etc.

And of course, music and sound effects which i'm already working on. 

Let me know what you think! Obviously I'm leaving out certain things, this isn't the entire write up, but it's enough (i think) to get a general idea of how the game works. 

Thanks again for showing interest!

IndieGaming,"Hey /r/IndieGaming.  I'm literally a day or two away from submitting my game, PikiPop to go into review on the Apple App Store.  Since I found out that today is my 7th year as a redditor, I thought I'd do something different than ""check out this meme image somehow related to my cakeday"".. I thought I'd share some images &amp; info about my game and some basic info without hopefully getting all salesy about it. (and being on par with the self promotion rules)

Here's the [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/2kBoo )

Here's the basic details on this game:

1) I coded this game almost* entirely in Swift, the new programming language Apple announced back in June. (*The custom font functionality used an Objective-C bridge)

2) It's a simple 2D sidescroller; you control a yellow a spanish cockatiel named Piki via both taps and swipes to pop balloons, collect coins and avoid thunder clouds (maybe other types of obstacles in future updates)

3) The game and it's updates/addons will be all free and none of that freemium, pay to play stuff.  As you can see in the screenshots, it will be ad supported though, hopefully I made the ads as unobtrusive as possible, only showing in the title, pause and gameover screens.  I might eventually make the only in-app purchase be a one time $.99 fee to fully remove the ads.. but again, trying to keep away from the freemuim stuff.  I'm an old school gamer so I don't lean toward the ""buy extra lives"" stuff.. and, in all honesty, the game is at the moment rather simple; extended only by the achievements and leaderboards    

3) It's first version will be available on iPhones and iPads (IOS 8.0 and above) but if I can, I'll port to Android too; looking to maybe use the MyAppConverter service once that's available.

4) Most of the art, text and animation was done by me with some purchased on ShutterStock (the far background sky image, the yellow ribbon in the title screen).  The intro music for the game was a song gracefully given to me to use by the chiptunes artist, Ben Landis; I'm currently composing a simple in-stage song as we speak.

The idea of the game came from me wanting to code in Swift after doing a, still unfinished, game for a few years in Objective-C.  The game also was the idea of my fiancee since early this year we lost our long time companion, our 16 year old Spanish cockatiel named Pikachu.  Obviously we can't use the name Pikachu so we hope to somewhat immortalize her with this game and thus named her ""Piki"" 


Links to the game will be of course done separately in Reddit's advertising system and the other correct channels.

**Introduction:**
Hey reddit! As you know, finding ways to get people to try your game is hard work, probably harder than making the game itself and there is a good chance this post will sink like a rock tied to another rock. I am a programmer but it can often be hard or impossible to find artists to help me out, thus I have had to learn to make all of the art myself for this one! Turns out, people actually liked the art... and the game! But these are just people I know. I would love Reddit to give it a try and tell me what they think. Only 5 people downloaded it yesterday but I know it deserves more than that! Right? Hopefully!? Keep in mind the leaderboards are currently down and I apologize for that. Even so, the game should still be fun (in theory). If you still need convincing, I am the programmer of the twice-featured Glacier Rush mobile game which was a hit with kids apparently.

**Game Description:**
The game may look like a Flappy Bird clone at first glance but it is pretty different. You are limited to 4 flaps and a floating ability which means you spend some time on the ground. There is a Vampire Hunter trying to kill you which introduces a new level of planning to the mix that I haven't really seen in this type of game. I think you'll find it more challenging and rewarding that something like Flappy Bird. There is a lot of detail that you can't see in the screens like the lightning and the super spooky voices and sounds. I love questions so feel free to ask me anything about myself, the game, or whatever.

IndieGaming,"I have been gaming for the vast majority of my life. However, my wife is a relatively new gamer, and I've had the pleasure of introducing her to PC/console games during our courtship. She has just recently come to understand the sexist issues behind Gamergate, and she feels that it affects her personally as a new female gamer.

The impression that I get about the entire situation is that there is a lot of unfocused outrage. In other words, there is a lot of talk and argument, but not a whole lot of doing. It seems like most who are involved in this whole controversy are slacktivists when it comes to sexism in gaming and Gamergate. Am I incorrect in this assumption?

My wife and I would like to help in some sort of tangible and meaningful way. One of the beliefs that we both have is that in order to help reduce the sexism in gaming, we need to encourage and involve more young women in game development, and provide safe places for women to game online.

To this end, we have supported the No Heroes community in the past, which provides servers that are focused on providing an inclusive, mature environment for online play. We would also like to help out on the development end of things as well, but we have no idea where to start. Does anybody know of any organizations, campaigns, or events that encourage women to get involved in game development? I figured that the indie gaming community would be a good place to start.

Thanks in advance.",A serious question about how to combat sexism in gaming
IndieGaming,"Hi IndieGaming!

My name's Dan Carreras, and I'm an indie developer (Like so many of us here).

I've been working for these last 10 months on a game called Twixel, a game which mixes Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons together with Super Hexagon to make for a challenging and addictive arcade game. 

You'll control your left pixel (the blue one) with the A and D keys on your keyboard, and control the right pixel (the red one) with the arrow keys. In doing so, you'll need to avoid every obstacle which is sent your way, with the Easy level starting you off with static obstacles, Medium difficulty sending moving obstacles your way, and Hard sending both static and moving obstacles towards the pixels. 

This is my first full game after working on many small projects. Having never been great at programming at uni I pushed through with my limited skills and constant research to make something I feel can be played endlessly. 

I would love some feedback from you all! I know my trailer isn't amazing right now, but I feel it at least shows off a little of what the gameplay entails. Please give me feedback on the submission and whether you feel I should write more in the description. 

The Steam Greenlight page can be found below:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=329120750

I must also thank you all for any questions that were answered in the past and your constant posts which have motivated me to continue on with this project.

I look forward to hearing your questions!

IndieGaming,"We’re proud to announce that next Monday, November 17th, we’ll be hosting our first official AMA. We're going to have some wonderful people from [E-Line Media](http://elinemedia.com/) here to talk about their new game, *[Never Alone](http://neveralonegame.com/)* or *Kisima Inŋitchuŋa*. 

Our three participants will be David Koenig - Lead Engineer, Grant Roberts - Lead Game Designer, and Dima Veryovka - Art Director.

The AMA will be posted by one of the moderators at **8am PST**, and it will include mini bios of the developers and proof of identity. The E-Line team will be answering questions from **11am to 1pm PST**. We're incredibly excited to host this AMA. *Never Alone* is an example of gaming as more than just running and jumping, puzzles and tasks; it's a showcase of gaming as a medium, as an art form, as cultural heritage. 

##About the game

[*Never Alone* - Game Trailer - vimeo - 2:13](http://vimeo.com/92000406)

&gt; Never Alone is an atmospheric puzzle platformer that delves deeply into the traditional lore of the Iñupiat people of Alaska, and incorporates Alaska Native elders and storytellers into the development team. It will be available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC (via Steam) starting November 18th.
&gt; The game is a unique co-venture between E-Line Media and the Cook Inlet Tribal Council (CITC), a leading provider of social, educational and employment services to Alaska Native people. The two organizations came together to create a commercially viable game built on the principles of cultural storytelling via an inclusive development process.
&gt; Through Never Alone, E-Line Media and CITC hope to deliver a world-class game experience that builds upon the stories and culture of Alaska Native people. They also believe that, through inclusive and participatory development, this model can be extended into a ""World Games"" category with Never Alone representing the first of many stories based on unique human cultures.

The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

","Self Promotion Megapost, 10 November 2014"
IndieGaming,"Hi /r/IndieGaming!

The purpose of this text post is twofold. Our studio just released [our third advergame](http://purplepwny.com/brads_rough_draft/), which hardly anyone has played, and we'd like for more people to have the opportunity to play it since the sponsor really dropped the ball on this one and won't be promoting it in any direct way.

Second, working on this game really got our thought juices flowing, and we'd like to open up a platform for discussion on whether or not advergames can be considered ""indie,"" and why they're generally considered not to be—in addition to being perceived as ""uncool"" or of lesser quality. Sponsored games are one of the few reliable sources of income for indie developers, and one of the few ways an indie dev can assure exposure to their hard work. Unfortunately, indie developers often aren't credited for their contributions to advergames in any public way, so when people see the developer listed as ""Disney"" they assume that the game is quite the opposite of ""indie,""even if this isn't actually true.

Though not an advergame, one example of a game that would _appear_ to not be at all indie is Star Wars: Tiny Death Star.
Here's it's page in the [app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucasarts.tinydeathstar_goo&amp;hl=en), and [here are](http://www.tinman-studios.com/#!tiny-death-star/c160b) [some](https://www.behance.net/gallery/15431023/Star-Wars-Tiny-Death-Star-UI) [artists](http://www.joziasdawsondesign.com/#item=tiny-death-star) that worked on the game.

Granted, advergames must frequently make concessions to their sponsor, but this doesn't have to make them bad games. I grew up playing Neopets, which, as some may remember, is basically a virtual hub of advertising to children. If you poke around, you can uncover a surprising number of indies who have played some part in one Neopets advergame or another. The same people that make the games that you love also made the games that you hate.

Basically, we just think it's unfair to treat a studio as any less indie or respectable just because they've had to make some ""low art"" to pay the bills. At the same time, we find ourselves naturally judging other studios as less indie for having worked on advergames. It's just not _cool_.

Of course, this leads into the question for the ages—what exactly is ""indie""? Why wouldn't an advergame developed by some two person studio for peanuts in their basement be considered indie? It's likely the definition has shifted quite a bit as the environment and economy of game development has changed, and it's certainly not as black-and-white as might be ideal. We're interested to hear what you all have to say about this.


",Can advergames be indie?
IndieGaming,"Hey there good people,

In the passing weeks, 5 friends and me developed 6 seperate games about a single theme. We are delighted with the result of this little experiment on testing our skills. Among the developers, there's names you might know as [Kayabros](http://kayabros.itch.io/) and [Aslan GS](http://aslangames.itch.io/self).

IndieGaming,"Hi,

I'm making a platformer game (it's very early stage and won't share any links or such to aviod being classified as self-promotion) and all the graphics as basically rectangles (say, similar to Thomas Was Alone). I recall from some interview with Jonathan Blow that he did the same for Braid and added the art later. But I have a doubt whether to leave those as they are, or find an artist to make it shine.

I'm afraid that having professional art would ruin the ""indie"" feel of the game.

Does anyone know how for example Braid compares to VVVVVV regarding the number of players the game reached and popularity? It seems to me that Braid was way more popular, but I cannot discern if it was for the better gameplay or better graphics.

I wrote ""graphics"" instead of ""art"" because some stuff like music is IMHO, on-par.

IndieGaming,"I took my in-development vehicle combat game [Scraps](http://www.scrapsgame.com/) to Pax Australia last weekend. What a huge event. The Melbourne Convention centre is massive, lots of people came though, lots of cool games that I wish I had more time to check out.

[The Scraps booth.](http://i.imgur.com/JiloMjh.jpg)

Scraps was in the ANZ Indie Pavilion area.

Equipment: Far left Galaxy tablet for email signup, then 2012 MacBook Pro, Surface Pro 2, and HP Pavilion for Scraps LAN gaming. One AI payer was also active on the map.

Wish I could have taken home those giant Scraps banners on the plane. They're too thick to roll up and they're 1mx2m each.

[Some video](http://youtu.be/ZGR9kh2P1Qw?list=UUII6jyeRHcLbCNEGAlAzi4g).

It's hard to judge exactly how worthwhile exhibiting actually was, especially without a game for sale to directly gauge cost vs. extra sales (a booth in the Indie Pavilion cost $1,200AU this year). Everyone seemed to be enjoying it and often played for a while, and I met a bunch of cool devs and managed to play a few really interesting games ([Expand](http://expandgame.com) is particularly impressive in person - a simple concept executed with wonderful creativity). So far I've seen a bit of extra traffic to the Scraps website but not much in the way of press etc.

This was my first BIG event, so I learnt a few things as well. If I went again I think I'd change a couple of things:

* Get a big screen. Although we had people playing all three laptops just about the whole time (which was great), games with a big TV screen definitely attracted more crowds. I didn't bring a big screen because of the logistics in getting it across the Tasman Sea, but I think I'd pay the cost of hiring something next time.
* More interesting giveaways. People seem to talk about games they saw at PAX for two main reasons: The game was *really* unique and interesting, or the game had unique and interesting swag. The [Swordy](http://swordygame.com) guys' wooden [LASER-cut badges](http://https://twitter.com/nomand/status/524437594164056064) were a step above the rest and gave people a reason to talk about Swordy in social media. [Tearaway](http://www.mediamolecule.com/games/tearaway) had paper hat things which was nice free advertising as people walked around PAX with them on.

[Some physical Scraps stuff.](http://i.imgur.com/q1SmYZj.jpg)

It'd be awesome to have some little 3D printed Scraps vehicles or something. I had two big stacks of Scraps magnets, which went *very* quickly - bring like 1000+ of whatever you've got to PAX as well. After that I made a stack of budget hand-written Scraps cards and even those went pretty fast.

A few bugs also came up, as happens when hundreds of people play your unreleased game right after each other. One of them involves people grabbing an item on the build screen and not being able to drop it, and I *cannot* work out how to make it happen myself. Yet. Before participating in any more big events, the current goal is get the game out.",[SP - Game] Report on taking my game Scraps to PAX Australia 2014

By rotating the device the player helps a little hamster called Bruce to bounce in his wheel, collecting nuts and loads of other stuff.

An easy-to-learn but extremely hard-to-master gameplay, a dynamic difficulty adjustment and the funny and playful graphics make this game a really challenging and rewarding experience, in our opinion enjoyable for hours on end.

IndieGaming,"  In the very near future, the ability to read and write code will be as ubiquitous as ordinary literacy is today. Even now, as software and information technology continue to reshape the world we live in, greater and greater numbers of people are finding not only substantial professional advantages by learning and plying their skills with programming languages, but also finding increasing personal and creative advantages as well. And while the web and countless numbers of for-profit higher education companies seek to take advantage of those seeking to learn these skills, many are being left behind due to either lacking the financial resources to enroll in such programs, or merely finding the pursuit of them daunting.

   For these –and a number of other- reasons, Code Here is seeking to create a new, more user friendly, and best of all free resource to help those who wish to train themselves in the art and science of this new literacy gain the skills they need to advance themselves professionally, artistically and technologically.

Hey, guys.

I'm the designer, coder, and sound engineer for [FatBot](http://www.vaporum-game.com/press/), a small video-game indie studio, developing **Vaporum**, a dungeon crawler (think *Dungeon Master* or *Grimrock*) in a dark steampunk setting. We've been working on a functional demo for some months now, all in our spare time. Typical, right?

Encouraged by the (not so) recent success of [Legend of Grimrock](http://np.reddit.com/r/grimrock/), we decided to take the leap to create our own dungeon crawler, a genre we loved back in the day, adding lots of our inventions and ideas to the working formula.

Today, I'd like to share a short gameplay video, showing off some action combat and interaction with a puzzling machine, one of many in the game.

What you can expect with this tittle? A free-to-play game with unique gameplay but should feel familiar to all first person shooter (FPS) fans. It demonstrated how Unity Engine looks great on Windows Phone devices with great lighting effects, environment details and smoothly control just like every AAA titles on the market. 

**Story: Super-secret project turned wrong**

The setup is simple. World War III happened, government worked on their “Super Soldier” project, but it turned out the company they hired have betrayed and triggered a Zombie Apocalypse to destroy the world. You as a main character will have to stop before it’s too late. 

**A “Frozen” FPS game, this time more serious**

Can’t move? It’s not a bad joke; it made the game less safety, less predictability. You cannot runaway, nor find a safe place to hide, just face to zombie and don’t forget aim for the head. Also you will have ton of destructive weapons and plenty of upgrades, along with different kind of zombies with different abilities.

IndieGaming,"My name is Zack Sporen and I'm here to support a friend in his big endeavor. I've known Anthony Conta and the most of the team at Urban Island Games for about a year now. We first met while on the demostration team for a collectible card game. This gig was orchestrated in part by a long-time nerd culture &amp; games industry maven, Brian David-Marshall. I don't know where I'd be right now if it weren't for working with them, so I'm going to show my support in the best way I know how: Running my mouth.

When Anthony told me that he was going to launch two campaigns in the same period, I knew how dauntless he was in the pursuit of success. (Re-launching Funemployed &amp; Introducing Emergents) Here's some about each:

Funemployed is the satirical job application party game for 3 or more players. Make your best pitch for different jobs using four qualifications not fit for any real job interview. Creativity and the ability to spin a good story are key. It is tricky to justify your ""burrito"" qualification when applying for the job of astronaut. After all players have had their ""interview,"" the interviewer selects the person who created the best story out of their qualifications. That person wins the card and a new round starts. It's not always easy to explain why Fairy Dust, Jacked Forearms, Treats, and a Time Machine make you the most qualified to be a Competitive Eater, but we have faith you can do it.

Emergents: Genesis is a new PvP, multiplayer deckbuilding game where players take on the role of powerful superheroes—known in this world as Emergents—and battle against the other players in the game to be the last person standing. Players customize their decks based on four classes of superpowers in a fast-paced game that can be played by two to four players. Designed by Urban Island Games and Top8Magic, Emergents: Genesis introduces innovative, interactive mechanics to the deckbuilding game that will appeal to all fans of both the superhero genre and interactive card games. Emergents: Genesis takes place in an original universe by game designer and comic creator, Brian David-Marshall and features art from a host of best-selling and award-winning comic book artists headlined by Steve Ellis. 

I've had the privilege of playing them numerous times, in and out of testing and offer them both a seal of approval for all it's worth as a designer, a developer, a gamer, and most importantly, as a friend. The funding periods of both projects are open now, please offer your honest consideration to either or both. Thanks.

IndieGaming,"In August me and my friend decided to develop a simple mobile game with one mechanic. Jump over a cliff, that was it. Each successful jump lowered a magma wall to reveal a digitally drawn picture of the main character (SFW) in the back ground. 

Initially when we launched we wanted to go the way of creating an insanely difficult game. People didn't seem to like it much. We found out from our friends who played the game that they lost interest quick. When asked the question why did you make it so hard, we replied, flappy bird is hard (over simplified)...but at some point we figured that the toughness of the game was not contributing to its popularity and people were more pissed than ""I must beat this"". Obviously flappy bird had a massive boost from PewDiePie, which gave it some sort of cult status of 'the game to beat"". We didn't have this, so all the rage quitters were starting to hurt downloads. Note that I'm not talking about massive numbers here, not even close. Hundreds is the magic number here, it is rising steadily tho. Just yesterday 17 Nov 2014, we heavily tweaked the game play and now we are seeing return gamers, plus most of our friends now like it.

**How did it start.**

August we launched a Kickstarter for another game and as we were waiting for it to conclude, we decided to create a simple mobile game that we called **Hot Lava**. 

Development wasn't hard as it required very little in art assets, we had the game finished within a week. We used Game Maker Studio to ""program"" the game, which was simple enough as my friend knew his way around said program.

**Getting the word out.** 

This is the main area where we learned some interesting stuff. As the title said, we had $0 for this game. 

*The Release* hah release...

Releasing a game made with third party tools is always risky as there might be complications. And with the launch of IOS 8, meant that Game Maker wasn't able to build for it, due to some bug we had. We had to release the Android and PC version first and wait until we got the bug fixed. Also the 2 week submission process on the App store didn't help.

*Social media*

Utilizing your social media to promote your game. Now this is an obvious choice, but how useful is it if you don't have hordes of followers and ""friends"". Couple the fact that we are pretty unknown this seemed to be an impossible task. 

*Facebook*

Thus far Facebook has been the most useless social site to use...for us at least. (Personally I don't like using Facebook, this might be important.) 

*Twitter* 

I didn't have a Twitter account before October this year, and my friend didn't use his. I went out to remedy this situation and created one. I was able to get 70+ followers in a month, which I believe is pretty good for someone who hadn't used it before. I try to make my posts on twitter have engaging content, as an artist it's probably easier for me as I have ""pretty"" pictures to show. It seems to be contributing towards downloads, but only a little. Building a presence takes time.

*Deviant Art.*

Now I do have some followers there and a group that's relatively big, and I did post about the game there. Note that I didn't write post such as ""go download this"", I tried to post interesting content form the side of the dev. Getting lots of views and very little downloads. Still experimenting with this to see what clicks.

*Website*

Created a website for the game and well what do you know, nothing. No surprise there as who would know to look for it. But it is important to have as we are now getting traffic there after posting to:

*REDDIT*

Reddit is tricky, now I'm not very good at posting to Reddit. I don't have a cat...must be it. Tho a few days ago I posted to r/freegames and boom 500 page views on the game site and we got some 40 new downloads. Reddit in the past has proven to be much more effective than any thing else out there, even if you only get 2 or 6 points. I can't imagine if a post on Reddit is successful what that might entail.
So if you are a game dev and you know how to use Reddit, you sir are one lucky MOFO. 

*Press Kits*

Still figuring this one out...I'll get back to this if I get a the game mentioned on some indie gaming site...if.

*Game mechanics and balance*

As I stated before, originally the game was super tough. You needed 15 consecutive jumps to win the game and if you died the counter would reset to 0. I was able to beat it once, but it was ridiculously hard, cant even count the number of times I tried and quit. 

Now we have released a major update for Android (update coming for IOS, 2 week submission process and all that). We made the jumping mechanism more flexible and you only lose 5 points off your score if you die and added auto save when you quit, so you can pick up your progress later. Also we upped the jumps needed to reveal the drawing to 50. This has resulted in a hell of a lot more fun game to play. Only time will tell if this was the right choice.

In conclusion I can say that developing and promoting a game with no budget is super tough. One thing tho, you appreciate every download, I was ecstatic when we cracked a 100 downloads. So not every game is a 1 million download success story, but I wonder, how many good games go unnoticed.

If you find this a good read, I thank you for taking the time, if not, terribly sorry for wasting it.

You can check out the game at: **[hotlavagame.com](http://hotlavagame.com)**


EDIT: The aim of this article is not to ask the question why aren't we successful and getting millions of downloads, we are aware of why and are working to expand our games to have loads of content. It's more to give an overview of what we have done and what we have learned, as this helps us be more prepared and have the info we need to do a successful launch with our larger games. Hopefully it helps someone else as well.

*PC*

I bought this arcade skateboarding game as part of HumbleBundle. Your objective is skating as far as you can along short, but somewhat demanding levels featuring stairs, railings, vehicles, obstacles. Along the level you get scores for tricks, grinds and combos.

With 8 key controls the game seems to be easy, but it is relatively unforgiving, which makes you wanna beat it. I mean, how many times can you smash your face into the floor just after landing an epic 20x combo?! After a few minutes you can play the game and after 1-2 hours you get to know more tricks and are able to get quite impressive scores.

The game features classic 8-bit arcade graphics style and urban music floating between trance, hip-hop and dubstep (no vocals).

Is it fun? Yes it is. You want to win the level. You want to land the combo. You want to beat your friends' score online (there are leaderboards). The graphics is retro-cool (but at times too simplistic and repetitive) and the music creates right skateboarding mood. At the same time it is a little annoying, especially after multiple failures. Despite easy controls I tend to mix up the keys in the heat of the moment. Music is good, but it just runs in the background, isn't related to levels or your activity/performance. Some levels are repetive, but the in-game achievements vary from level to level. There are multiple themes including city, port and junkyard. Some are better than others, for example in port the lack of detail on the floor makes it difficult to estimate your current speed. There are some bugs. The game crashed for me once.

It is a nice little game definitely worth getting in some bundle. Depending on how much you like arcade games you will have 5-20 hours of fun until it gets a little boring.

What I remember about it:

* I think it was singleplayer

* 3D

* RTS-style overhead view

* You built a village, and it took place in old times

* You send villagers off to do tasks, and I believe they excelled to become professions based on the tasks you assign them.

* You have to stock up supplies for the harsh winter

* When villagers died they went into a graveyard, and you could see what they died from, their age, etc


Does that ring a bell for anyone?","I'm trying to remember the name of an indie game I found a few months ago. I was in an RTS-style view, took place in old times, you had to build up your village, and prepare enough food and firewood for the winter.. and I think it was single player?"

Ben Tester here from Wales Interactive, developers of Soul Axiom, Master Reboot and Infinity Runner. 

I am sure you're all aware of the abundance of fake YouTubers asking for games codes. I have experienced some very sneaky ones. Often, they are very easy to spot, the majority of requests I receive are of Russian YouTubers that don't have there email address listed on their channel. If the YouTubers don't have some sort of business email in their 'About' section then it's likely I won't chase them!

*So what's your tactic? Do you ignore them, try to verify it or just report them? Do you think reporting them would help in any way?*

Here's a couple of tips I would like to share with you all, for anyone who is new to this.

* The first thing is to check if the email address that is used is the same as the one listed on their YouTube 'About' section. 

* If their's no email then ask them politely to message directly to your YouTube Channel. Explain the reason why you have to ask them to do that. Be friendly, if it is a legit reviewer, you don't want to scare them off. 

* Keep an eye out for certain requests. If they ask for ""1 code for me and 1 more to speed up the process"" or ""1 code for me and more for giveaways"" then alarm bells should be ringing. It's not that common for YouTubers to ask for extra codes for giveaways unless they are linked to certain gaming websites.

Hi everyone! I'm a web designer and the PR face for a game called Alchemia, developed by a new indie Philadelphia company called Fox and the Little Prince, LLC. It's a work of love from students at Drexel University who wanted to design, produce, and release a great puzzle game.

**Alchemia**

Alchemia is a twist on the Match Three puzzle genre. Draw a line between more than three elemental blocks and you can create a new element. These new elements are additive - see if you can use your alchemic match three skills to create gold blocks and last as long as you can!

It was developed in Unity in under a year with the cooperation of some very dedicated individuals led by artist Don Xu and programmer Zach Howell, who co-designed Alchemia.

IndieGaming,"Howdy.
I'll start off by saying what games I don't (usually) like. I tend to not like 3d games that try to imitate reality by making things look realistic or semi realistic.  There are a few that I like, but I don't like this type usually. (granted this type includes many genres)

What I'm looking for now are games that have great artwork in the game and are not attempting to remake reality for me.  
A few games that I have played and enjoy are the following:
The child of light
Rayman legends (the latest one)
The Transistor

These all happen to be a platforming type of game, but the games you recommend don't have to be.  
I also played Monument Valley and enjoyed it.  I also tend to like the two legend of zelda for ds games and the legend of zelda HD remake for Wii U (I forget the name).. I'll edit the post when I remember.  

Anyway I have an acquired taste for games and most of the games I happen to stumble upon while looking for games do not appeal to me. So that is why I'm asking for recommendations here.  Thank you.. 

P.S. I also like it to be full.  I can only explain that by giving an example of the opposite.  So in some games, the game is in the center of an area while the surrounding area is just darkness.  So only about 1 /3rd or 2/rd of my monitor would be having something playable on it.  The rest of it is darkness.  I'm assuming most of the games that have this are in some sort of outer space or something like that.  

peace

So me and a friend went through ""Gone Home"" recently and really enjoyed the atmosphere and story telling, but in the end it fell short to us since there was never any danger. The game hypes of ""Oscar"" in parts and you're expecting something to be there, but in the end there was nothing. Good game, but I was expecting another element.

Suck Eggs! is a 2d scroller game I've been working on over the past couple of months and the goal is to suck as many eggs as you can in a row.  If you miss an egg, crack an egg or smash the sucker, it's game over.

I designed the graphics and decided to go the pixelated / retro look.

I used the Corona SDK to develop the game and it's been a lot of fun.  I'm just completing small changes needed for Android at the moment.

The game is pretty hard.  To achieve my high score of 88 eggs sucked I probably sucked around 100,000 eggs during development, testing game play.  And I'm tired of having the high score in Game Center!

Anyway, I just thought some of you might like to know about it.  Heck maybe some of you might attempt beating my high score (as my friends are having a hard time sucking more than 5 eggs!!)

IndieGaming,"Hello /r/indiegaming! Let me tell you the tale of my last 9 months, starting with the day I decided to create my first real mobile game. Not sure where I should post this, so please tell me if it's not the right place.

I've been programming for some time and had a fun idea for a game so I began in February with a pencil and a piece of paper where I drew my gameplay ideas. Many sketches and many headaches later, I began the actual programming. It did not take long before I had a working (and ugly) prototype, here's a photo of what it looked like:

http://i.imgur.com/knegJsV.png

Not stopping the development and burning down my computer was the hardest part of this experience: so many bugs to flatten, so many problems to troubleshoot, so many new concepts to grasp... In the end, I was under the impression that for each solved problem, two new one popped up, every time. It was an exhausting experience, especially since I had a school to go to and a job at the same time.

The game progressed, I found an artist online to do the graphics and the game was recently released for both Android and iOS, for free. (It's at version 1.01 right now :p)

The goal is simple: playing as a pig on a jackhammer, you must collect as many carrots as you can while avoiding boulders on your way. Please take a look at it and tell me what you think!

You can find it in a Unity Web Player [here](https://www.googledrive.com/host/0BxGUMMFh0pYPM2FHNk1qUTZrMXM).

First, select ""Play Game"", then any level size.

The idea behind Fish and Chips is that you place objects when you click with the left and right mouse. You can open up the menu on the right side, expand it to choose what objects you want to place, and close it back out then place those objects.

A good place to start is ""Stretch Blocks"" (in ""Still"") and ""Creature 1"" (in ""Creatures""). Note that Creature 1 can be controlled via wasd, and you can press c to use your ""weapon"". There are also options to the left side of the screen, where you can tweak the parameters of pretty much anything: for example modifying the weapon of all future Creature 1's.

* Pricing: Free - May add in app purchases at a later point.

Hi all! I'd like to present my first ever developed and published game: **Drop Blocks**.

I've been working on it for a little under 10 Months and am very proud of what I've accomplished. All assets and scripts are my own original work, except for the music which is provided by [**Deramico**](http://deramico.com/). Here's a brief description of the game:

&gt;Drop Blocks is a casual and fun puzzle like survival game where your objective is to drop heavy blocks on to other smaller blocks. You will receive points for every block destroyed, and bonus points for every second you're alive. However, be careful not to let the blocks drop on you, or it's game over!
Crushing blocks will give you points based on their weight, and it will add a temporary multiplier to how many points you earn per second. The longer you go without destroying a block, the faster they will drop! Crush several blocks quickly in a row to get a hot streak going and slow down the Block Dropper.

The game is inspired by a small game/project I had to make in my intro level Game Design course at school. I liked the idea so I decided to do a rough sketch on a [**piece of paper**](http://imgur.com/y8v6qoc) in English Class. From there I took the idea and slowly started building a game in Java. I ended up with a result I was quite proud of, (having no true prior GameDev experience at the time), but it was clunky and designed ad hoc. At this point I decided it would be worthwhile to learn Unity so I could not worry about the engine, and instead focus on the actual Game.

I'd love for feedback and critique on what can be done better or how to make it more fun. Please let me know about any issues or crashes, this is my first release so this is to be expected. I'm especially interested in feedback from tablet users. The game should work on tablets, but I have as of yet been unable to test on any.

Please also do not hold back any questions regarding my design process or tools.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name.

Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

IndieGaming,"Anyone who grew up gaming in the 8bit and 16bit era probably played a lot of multiplayer games. The kind where you are in the same room as the person you're playing with, typically a friend or sibling. Somehow that style of gaming is now not the norm and online multiplayer is much more prevalent. Probably for money reasons.

I'd say that, as a social experience, you can't beat local multiplayer when it comes to gaming. I think online pales in comparison when it comes to having fun gaming sessions. The last couple years saw some local multiplayer games rising to prominence, Nidhogg and TowerFall being two good examples.

Hopefully 2015 will see even more. My own contribution to that will be our game BFF or Die. It's a local co-op for up to 4 players. It's so co-op you can even share the input devices :) So shared control pads or shared keyboard.

I've been talking it to game events as part of the development process. By seeing people play at each stage we've been able to make sure that the gameplay has the effect we wanted. BFF or Die is all about the enjoyment of playing and winning as a team. I like taking video clips at events as people play and you can see some of their reactions in the [youtube vids](https://www.youtube.com/user/HoneyTribeStudios) I've made. As the designer of the game it's really nice to see their positive reactions.

We just released a new update, alpha v0.1.8. Lately we've been making an effort to make it more accessible so that new players can get into the game without having known anything about it previously. If you like meeting up with friends/family to play games then give it a go..!

IndieGaming,"Hello! I'm a huge fan of Metroid like games, and recently there seems to be a few in development. I made one myself about two years ago (Operation Smash), but I felt like the game didn't really have anything unique to it, and it didn't really stand out in the crowd. As I am polishing the game up for release on Steam, I would like to redesign it a bit, maybe make room for a new mechanic or two. I've been thinking hard lately about how to take the Metroidvania/Adventure Platformer genre forward, and would love to hear thoughts from other fans of the genre out there. What would you like to see in future metroidvanias?

Some thoughts i have (most of them already done multiple times obviously):
-Multiple locomotion modes, like flying/walking/driving (a'la Blaster Master, A.N.N.E, Morph ball etc)
- Light/Dark world (A Link to the Past)
- Glitch stuff (like getting outside of the map, etc)
- Have the world wrap around the edges
- Separate overworld map mode (Zelda 2, Super Win the Game)
- Open world features (borrowed from 3d games, such as quest givers, radio towers, hunting etc)
- Minecrafty stuff (Terraria etc.., materials, crafting etc, done to death by now)
- More story heavy (cut scenes, scripted events within the game, escort missions etc)
- Tower Defence influences (like, mount a bunch of sentry guns like in Alien 2 to protect locations from enemies)
- Resource management (refine resources in multiple steps, carry it around the map, craft or buy items from it)
- Mini games (like Deus Ex hacking)
- RPG elements (leveling up, tech trees etc..)
- Procedurally generated maps
- Switch characters (Lost Vikings, Ufouria)

Obviously if you look inside the very genre youre trying to renew, you will walk in circles, so I'm starting to think about where to look for new influences to bring in. /Steve

Some time ago, in around 2011-2012, I saw a video on Youtube of a zombie survival game in development. It was an 8-bit zombie survival game [NOT the 8-bit survival 3-D game from 2014]. It was a top-down, non-isometric, pixel game that had a massive open world for you to survive in.

The trailer consisted of showing off the interiors of buildings, lighting, working vehicles [with crushing zombies], and I also believe shooting guns.

It was really awesome to see and I awaited heavily for its release, but soon enough, I begin to forget about it.

Come to three years later, Monday [11/12/15], and I decide I want to look for the game.

The video's gone.

In fact, the game now acts as if it never existed, like it was literally wiped clean from the face of the internet. No video, no post, no forum exists of the game.

I'm no video game marketing agent, but I think they'd do things like:  
Press Kits  
Contacting prominent youtubers and twitch streamers  
Twitter/Facebook/Whatevergram  
Word of mouthing to people   
Guerrilla tactics

I think marketing could be done with a null budget and be effective, but the marketing agent needs to know what to do.  So I'm thinking these people probably exist.

Since it plays best with two players on two iPads, we made it free, so everyone could try it with their friends.

Unlike other board games, both players play at the same time, which introduces new strategies not found in most games as you try to guess what your opponent is trying to do and plan a counter-attack. Due to the simultaneous play and captures, this will be unlike any x-in-a-row game you've ever played before.

Even though games only last 2-5 minutes, I've seen people play it together for hours at a time, because you just keep learning new strategies every game, so it has that ""just one more time"" factor to it.

Time and time again, I think back on this game and feel bad about how it didn't get the attention it deserved when it was released some years ago. A sequel to the original Spirit Engine in spirit only (haha) and a much more polished game than its predecessor.

I must've played through the game (which is not exactly short in its own right, especially considering how challenging the battles can be) at least three times. The character relations, their development is lovely, the story captivating, and the soundtrack by Josh Whelchel exquisite. But most of all, the combat system in one of the most interesting ones I've seen in an RPG and even non-boss encounters challenge you to use very varying tactics.

I can't help but feel that if this'd been released when Steam Greenlight, Kickstarter etc. became more popular, it'd have a cult following today. As it was, the game just didn't receive proper coverage.

Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  
  * Links to the project -   
  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.

IndieGaming,"I got told by my friend to try on this game and I played it for about a month now.
Just wondering whether this kind of game will be accepted by gamers around the world. 
It's again some kind of puzzle game with a few Japanese's nuance in it. When I was in level 7, there is these very complicated Japanese character in the middle of the screen, and I just ""woo"", how am I suppose to solve this ""puzzle"". 
Well... It took me awhile to actually solve it out and found it's pretty cool to ""walk"" around those cool character. 
Enjoyed the game a lot and I really like the simple yet challenging part of the game. Graphic wise I wouldn't comment a lot, because it's a puzzle and indies kind of game, so I am good with it. 
Well.. Honest speaking.. the overall is just fine, but there are too many advertisement inside the game which annoyed me sometimes. Could be better if that can be taken out or reduced.
Maybe that's one of the way to increase some fund for an Indie developer, but I am sure there must be some other way.
All the best to ""Q...""

The trailer was of a mini-world rotating in space starting with a natural earth with wildlife, etc. There was a female voice over explaining the timeline of humans coming into the world and evolving. As she speaks, the earth transforms through the timeline in a fast-paced time-lapse eventually ending up to something like today with skyscrapers, pollution, etc.

It then slows down, seeming to be the end when the voice-over says something like ""and they thought they were alone"" and the camera zooms out to show more of space with alien aircraft hovering/monitoring the mini-earth with an ominous, booming bass tone.

1. Yonder is a free to play 3rd person sandbox game, and will include things like:
    * Digging
    * Crafting
    * Mining
    * Building
    * Combat
2. The game, being an MMO, will be played on a 24/7 server hosted and coded by our own team. Because it will be a persistent server, we are implementing a system of buying settlements of land that you will own and be able to build on as you wish.
 
3. Currently, the game has just entered the Alpha stage of development, and already we have a working server and build of the game.

My team is getting ready to start a Kickstarter campaign (one of my teammates will be writing a sort of pre-mortem blog post on that later) and while researching other Kickstarter campaigns to see what helped the successful ones get funded and why the unsuccessful ones failed, the video became a point of discussion for us. Obviously the video is important and is one of the foremost representations of your project and your team, but the question we were asking is how much it influences the overall campaign.

I'm of the opinion that the Kickstarter video takes a back seat to the rest of the campaign page. You'll definitely notice if it's *not* there, but odds are you'll just scroll past it and read the project description and donation tiers, then use screenshots to gauge the quality of the project. Obviously the presentation of the rest of the page (ie: banners, infographics, etc.) will be major the factors here.

My teammate's opinion is that the video is the first thing you look at when you reach a Kickstarter page. He believes that most people will judge a project quite a lot on its video and that it is a major factor in convincing people that you're worth investing in. He obviously recognizes the importance of the rest of the page's presentation, just that the video is more important.

The biggest issue here is that we've both assumed that our behaviour upon reaching a Kickstarter page is what ""most people"" do. I usually skip the video unless I need more information but it's always the first thing he checks out. Obviously one of us is a weirdo and I'd like Reddit's help to figure out who it is: just answer [this poll](http://strawpoll.me/3892755) and we can put it to rest. I'm sure anyone else considering a Kickstarter will find the results interesting too.",A poll on how you treat Kickstarter videos.
IndieGaming,"Hey, /r/IndieGaming! Just a week ago, I launched a subreddit for [Local Multiplayer Games](http://www.reddit.com/r/localmultiplayergames/) like Samurai Gunn and Starwhal.

It's still a work in progress, but I've got a few weekly super threads where self promotions are encouraged, including:

* *Fridays*: Games ([Week of 3/13/15](http://www.reddit.com/r/localmultiplayergames/comments/2ywsiv/friday_3132015_games/))

In Super Comic Kid, you play as a kid who loves comic books. You visit the nearby comic shop, purchase the newest releases, and bring them back to your secret hideout (a cardboard box in your room). Once home, you take up to three comic books into your lair and your imagination takes over. You zip into an action-packed, shoot 'em up-style level with the primary hero, villain, henchmen, music, and background art determined by your choice of comics.

**Who am I?**

My name's Joe, and I'm responsible for the art, some sounds, and a hefty amount of game design. The programming and other half of the game design was done by Dan (/u/Chanz). Together, we're DAJMAG.

From the onset, Dan and I wanted to create something that was mobile, lighthearted, cute, and challenging. So, we decided mash up some of our favorite comics with an approachable shoot 'em up game--something vaguely in the style of classic Gradius titles. Dan and I had worked together as a team before, but this is our first finished, released, and paid titles.


Over the course of a year of development, we've learned a lot about game development at large, our ability to dedicate ourselves to something entirely, and the creative process. Look for some posts of ours in the future that chronicle our journey in more detail. Overall, though, it's been an eye-opening process for two dudes who've always wanted to make games.


We put a lot of love, frustration, and long nights into this game and we're trying to get some eyeballs on it now without being entirely shameless. We'd love it if the fine folks of /r/IndieGaming would give it a glimpse and ask questions, offer feedback, or share any other thoughts on the finished product.


&amp;nbsp;  
**Why would you love the game?**

-We put a lot of work into making sure the *feeling* of moving up and down the screen launching your weapon at the enemy was spot on.

-There are seven different heroes to play with seven different weapons across seven different levels with seven different bosses. You can mix and match these variables to make for a lot of unique combinations.

-You earn coins from completing levels to buy new comics, but there are no microtransactions or in-app purchases.

-The game has very little in the way of text--it's designed to be a clean, simple, cute, fun experience.

-There's no main title screen. We keep all of the game scenes connected to try and make for seamless play. This was fairly experimental and the result is charming.


&amp;nbsp;  
**What now?**

-Check out our game, available for purchase on the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-comic-kid/id962893875?ls=1&amp;mt=8) and the [Android Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAJMAG.SCK&amp;hl=en)

-Check out our [website](dajmag.com)

-We have a little [teaser up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNZkQwxn7PY) you can check out.

-Respond with any comments or questions and either Dan or Myself will get back to you. 

-We've got a few iOS codes that we can give out if some of you guys want to give it a spin!

Thanks guys, we appreciate your time!

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  
  * Links to the project -   
  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.  


As always [subreddit rules apply](/r/indiegaming/rules). And remember: top level comments *must* include self promotion. Have fun everyone!

Solera: A peaceful planet filled with cat-like creatures called the Lumie. Among them is a studied cleric named Tila who lives with her sister, Tina. Tila decides one day to become a dungeon crawler like her father before her: someone who hunts treasure in dungeons, crypts, sewers, you name it. Dungeon crawling will soon show Tila that there is more to Solera than peace and tranquil minds as things unfold to tell a story not yet ready to be told. Follow Tila as she travels the lands for treasure and other things. 

A Dark Force has come to Solera and plans to disrupt the planet's flow of mana to gain who knows what. ""Wait what!? I'm just a dungeon crawler...go hire a hero!""

IndieGaming,"   I’m currently reading a book about the brain development. The main idea is - our brain is a large piece of ~~black~~ grey’n’white matter interested only in assistance of basic instincts satisfaction – food, reproduction, and dominance. Even a 40-day retreat in the Tibetan mountains may be all about egoistic dominance. Brain supports instincts at the lowest possible cost and may make us feel ok, even if dominance or reproduction is just an illusion. When it considers that any of these goals is achieved it express endorphins and sun shines brighter for us:) Rarely, brain can also thirst for such strange non-instinctive things as art and science. Thus, currently we have the majority of instinct-driven brains and minority of ratio- and esthetics-driven brains.
   The author considers that instinct-driven brain is hardly a straight way to the Idiocracy-like society, but still makes our progress slower and painful. The bad news is that the proportion of instinct-, ratio-, or esthetics- options become clearly hardwired (though some flexibility is possible) by some age. The good news is that proportion is not totally genetically determined and are influenced (thus, can be changed) while individual grows up. No doubt, the games, we make, are among the factors of the influence.
   I looked through my favorite or popular games and discovered that the majority of them exploit at least one of the above-mentioned instinctive goals. Conquer the universe, shoot all your enemies, win the princess. Pure esthetics, exploration and sense of discovery in best cases are supplementary, not among the leading goals of the game.
   I really do not want you to perceive this post as some lesson of morality or preachement. I know that we just make games people want to play (though they do not know what they want, until you show that), and we can’t pay bills with good deeds. 
   Anyway, do you realize, every time you start a project you not just make a hit product, but change people, world, even future story of the humankind.

v.1.05 brings in a couple of the features:
 
* Music! Indie chiptune artist [@beatscribe](https://beatscribe.wordpress.com/) is on the bill with 3 tracks, and at least one more to be added with the release of the next puzzle zone! OST is available on his site!
* Offline Play - Before the game requied an internet connection to play at all. Now, all puzzle and castle levels are included in the app, and only player-created levels require an internet connection. This is so that if your friend creates a level, you can play it on your app immediately without any sort of update to the app.
* Since we've reached 500 downloads across both platforms, We've added a new pack of levels containing 14 new puzzle challenges. 

The next expansion goal is set to 1500 downloads and will add a new castle level, and theme to go with it. We're currently at around 800.

Update your apps, or check it out for the first time on iTunes and Android! 

It's $1.99 and will never have ads, or in-app purchases, and all future expansions will be free updates:

IndieGaming,"I recently developed a multiplayer basketball game called [Bucketbattle](http://bucketbattle.com). It's a simulation game that's focused on controlling the on-court action through building a team and designing your own plays. I've always found other sports simulation games to be more focused on running a franchise through a season (or many seasons) and less about the sport itself, so I wanted to build one where you could feel like the coach rather than the GM.

The game is still in its early beta stages, so I'm constantly adding new things (there shouldn't be too many bugs, but there are planned features missing and I'm often coming up with entirely new features).

I don't know how many of you have experience with non-graphical sports simulations, but there are a lot out there, and multiplayer can often be difficult (if it's included at all) - it often requires a lot of coordination to form a league, etc. To get around that, I've designed my game around being an asynchronous multiplayer game with an open format, so you can play whoever you want, whenever you want (even without their approval). For now the teams are just ranked in a leaderboard, but I do foresee adding some more structure in the future (private leagues for people who do want to play that way, ranked randomized matchmaking ladders, etc).

It's based in a browser and the simulated games play out on the server, so you can play it from tons of different devices (I've played it from my computer, my iPad, and my Android phone with no problems). Making the games server-based should also help keep cheating down. You can step through a game a little bit at a time and watch your players move around the court and see your plays develop or you can just cut to the chase and simulate a game all the way to the end (if you choose this option, the game is placed in a queue and run when the server is free - it should only take a couple minutes to finish one game).

So, check it out at [Bucketbattle.com](http://bucketbattle.com) if you want, and if you have any features you'd like to see or bugs you'd like to report, head over to the sub I created just for this /r/Bucketbattle.

As I write this, I tell myself that this first post will not only serve as the introduction to our very first video game but also as a reminder to my partner and I of how far we have come (more on that later). Sure, we don’t have any gameplay to show off. Heck, we don’t even have an alpha build to give you a sense of what this game is about, nothing to whet an appetite for more. All we have is a working prototype. If you listen closely, you can hear the simultaneous mass closing of browser windows after I just stated that. But for those of you still sticking around, let me introduce you to Paragonyx’s first baby…

A platformer named [Super Blast Off!](http://www.paragonyx.com/games/super-blast-off/) But this will not be your run-of-the-mill platformer. The game will be much more than that. Ask Mike (my partner), I’ve even gone as far as to refer to this game as Super Mario on crack. At least that’s what we’re aiming for – to create a game as beloved and fun as the original Super Mario but with the technology and ideas of today. Realistically, that is no easy feat and one we can only dream of achieving. But hey, if you’re going to set goals, why not aim for the stars?

The concept of Super Blast Off! is simple – a 2D platformer with levels, items, and enemies that are [random, procedurally generated](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyGeneratedLevels). Add an elaborate scoring system based on performance and actions within the game to go along with the global leaderboards we have planned. Throw in some RPG elements cause why not?! And then you have the recipe for what could be a very fun and successful game with immense replay value – we hope.

The main source of inspiration for our game is the popular, [The Binding of Isaac](http://bindingofisaac.com/). Originally, we were going to create an isometric style game similar to it. However, we decided it would be more original and fun to create something different. It is not very common to see a platformer with random, procedurally generated levels but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t out there nor that Paragonyx is the first indie game developer to attempt something like this.

(The Binding of Isaac image)

The challenge of creating a game of this magnitude is in the technology. I’ll hand off the microphone keyboard to programmer guy and co-founder, Mike, so that he can briefly explain the technical side of Super Blast Off!

Random, procedurally generated levels, huh? It seems like it’s one of those new trendy words that are being thrown around a lot along with [rougelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike). Actually, procedural generation is a technique that has been used in several games over the decades including Rouge and Diablo to newer games like Minecraft and The Binding of Isaac. So what is procedural generation? At a high level, procedural generation is the creation of content according to inputs of an algorithm rather than manual creation by hand. In games, content can mean a lot of things. This can include levels, art, audio, AI, enemy placement, items, characters, story, etc.

Procedural generations works great in a lot of other genres aside from platformers. But it is still somewhat of an untapped territory for this type of technology to be used in a fast-paced platformer game. Being able to take the mind of a designer and putting it into a piece of code that can generate hand-crafted levels is simply hard. There is a lot of research that we are putting in to understand 2D platform level design. The approach we are taking is a rhythm-based level algorithm, still a work in progress, that uses a two-layered grammar-based approach for generating small chunks of geometry then converting a set of actions into corresponding geometry. With this, we also have to keep in mind that the design of the levels have to feel organic, they must be feasible and they have to be fun. I can go on and on about this and talk more tech but we’ll save that for another update.

(Rhythm-based level generation diagram)

Thank you Mike for that explanation. I’ll pretend that what Mike just wrote didn’t sound like astrophysics to me.

So in the opening paragraph, I stated that although we don’t have much to show (but a lot to say), Paragonyx has come far. Let me bring this post full circle and elaborate on that statement.

Many game developers, both independent and large, can attest that there is much more to game development than the art, programming, audio, quality assurance, etc. There is the business side of things; if game development is taken as a serious endeavor and not just a hobby. We have registered our business, opened up a business bank account, wrote a business plan, invested money out of our own pockets, borrowed money (thank you Mom), and many more things behind the scenes. In addition, there is also the interpersonal relationships in a team and with that comes the highs, lows, and lulz.

Regardless, at the end of the day, we’re all here for one thing – to create kick-ass games and succeed. I am proud that Paragonyx has reached the point where it is no longer just an idea or a dream in our heads; it is reality.

Yes, we are still in the beginning stage of production. And all we have for now are words, documents, and a prototype. But if you’re genuinely interested in Super Blast Off! or if you just want to see the game development process from start to finish then I suggest that you subscribe to our email updates (sign up form located at the end of this post) or follow us on social media. Tell your friends about us if you’re feeling nice.

We look forward to sharing developments with everyone. It is our hope that we entertain and provide inspiration, whether you’re a gamer and/or a game developer. We have higher hopes that along the way, you’ll actually want to play the game and buy it.

Anyway, I’ve ranted for far too long. Be on the look out sometime next week for our next update. Or you can just subscribe/follow and be notified of an update; it’s much easier than going to our website everyday and hitting refresh every 5 minutes, just saying.

P.S. I lied. We actually do have a first screenshot of our game to show you.

IndieGaming," PlusView is a review show for games released free for PSPlus users, today we talked about Never Alone. Below is the link of the video review and the written review.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUORZGE9agU

 - Never Alone (Kisima Inŋitchuŋa)

Never Alone is a puzzle-platformer game developed by Upper One with the Cook Inlet Tribal Council and published/developed by E-Line Media. It was released on November 18th 2014 for PlayStation 4 and PC; and November 19th for Xbox One. The Wii U version was announced to be released in 2015.
Never Alone tells us the story of the friendship between Nuna, an Iñupiat girl, and an arctic fox who saves her from a hungry polar bear. In-game you can choose switching between the two characters or connecting a second controller and playing with a local cooperative.

Storyline follows with an animated scrimshaw telling the story of a blizzard that shook a local village in Alaska. The tale ""Kunuuksaayuka"" by Robert Cleveland (the Nasruk) is told by James Mumigan Nageak in Iñupiat, just like an elder member of the community would do when telling a tale or reading an etching.

Solving the game's puzzles is simple, but at times you need to have good timing when moving the characters, specially on the single player mode. The couple's moves aren't always synchronized, so some times you may move a character fast and the other, being left a bit behind, might end up being killed; or if you don't switch them quick enough, one might fall or be caught.

The game presents many short documentaries about a specific reference or tradition to the Iñupiat culture that follows on the storyline, which you can choose to watch or not. Iñupiaq Cultural Ambassador Amy Fredeen shows tiny and interesting pieces of information, from the best clothing for hunting and how ice houses are built, to the life/death beliefs. In-game you can see elements from the Iñupiat culture, like the kilauwitawinmium (an instrument to hunt flying ducks), the regional drums and even geographic locations that are relevant.


Kisima Inŋitchuŋa, an Iñupiaq expression that means ""I am never alone"", brings a different way of seeing how we relate to Sila (the weather) and connect to the world around us. To the Iñupiaq, the sense of being part of a community is shown as every person is responsible for a big family. ",Never Alone [Kisima Inŋitchuŋa] Review &amp; Info - PlusView
IndieGaming,"**About me**

Hi everyone. I've been making small freeware games for the past few years. Last year, I entered into the Seven Day Roguelike challenge with a game called *Golden Krone Hotel.* It seems to have struck a nerve; one Let's Player actually called it his favorite 7DRL. There's currently a big push in the roguelike community to get more of these kinds of games on Steam. I've been a bit nervous about this since the game's scope is small and I'm just a single hobbyist. Yet I think the game is pretty special, so I've put in on Greenlight.

**About the game**

Golden Krone Hotel is a traditional turn-based roguelike with two big ideas that I feel are pretty unique:

1) You alternate between Human and Vampire form throughout the game. Humans are weak, but cast magic. Vampires are tough, but are dependent on blood. Changing to one form lets you easily get past enemies of that type (e.g. blending in with humans). Plenty of games would have these two forms as classes, but in Golden Krone Hotel you *have* to use both of them strategically in the same playthrough.

2) Dynamic Lighting that is actually central to gameplay. Humans can't see in low light, so as a human you want to be lighting up the place. When you turn vampire, however, you'll want to sneak around in the shadows because long range spellcasters are your biggest threat. And then there's **sunlight**. You can blast holes in the outer wall of the hotel to let in beams of sunlight (whose presence and direction depends on the time of day) and use those beams to destroy vampires.

If the game gets Greenlit, I have lots of plans for polishing it up and adding new content. For now though, I would love to hear any feedback you have on the game or the Greenlight campaign!

The game is pretty simple, just avoid the (slightly ambiguous) bombs and collect the spheres. Once you get a number of spheres you can jump through the gate to the next depth. You can tilt to slide left and right and tap anywhere on the screen to jump or double jump. There is also facebook connectivity for an unintrusive competitive aspect. Hope you enjoy!

It's my first completely independently made game. At it's core it was a research project into procedural music generation by using and modifying [Markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). The research was for my undergraduate dissertation and I decided I would actually finish a project once and for all and make the whole thing into a game. 

The game is quite simple and was initially designed as a base to mess around with music generation. The music itself probably the hardest part since I only had a couple of months on it before I had to hand in my dissertation so it wasn't super developed and in turn sounded bad. I've tried to fix it since then but it's be no means perfect and I probably wouldn't blame you if you muted your device :) It's taken me about 6 months part-time to complete. I made the game in unity and the music analysis stuff was done with a bunch of python scripts. (I think I'll throw those on github soon for people to use if they like). The art (or lack of it) was done by me too. It's gone through many styles and transformations in it's lifetime.

Anyway it was made for fun which is why its totally free, and I just hope people have a nice time playing it! :D Let me know if anything is broken. I tried to test it as thoroughly as I could but I'm only one person and there are always bugs. Also I'd love feedback on it (feel free to sugar coat it :D, I know the music can be a bit prickly at times, but I suppose that is part of the fun of a procedural feature! Sometimes you get super cool tunes and it feels great to play)

IndieGaming,"Hi fellow indie gamers! 

You might remember me from my post here a couple of months ago (this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/2rjgmv/thinking_about_starting_a_youtube_channel_for/[1] ) where I asked you if you would like to see a channel that review indie games on Steam. I got a lot of positive responses, but had to postpone starting the channel. I have started it about two weeks ago and have since then uploaded three videos.

The idea behind the channel is that I review the games in short videos of 2-5 minutes, so that you don't have to watch lengthy 'first impression' videos to know if the game is any good. The channel consists of two series: Alpha Inspection (is this early access game worth buying in alpha?) and Indie in Review (Is this indie game worth buying?)

There are a couple of reasons why I made this post. My accent isn't very good (I'm not a native English speaker), do you think it detracts from the video? And do you like these kind of short reviews?

The second reason is to ask the developers on here who have a game on Steam to let me review your games! I would love to review your game on my channel and I haven't received many responses on the developers I have emailed. 

And finally, if you also have a channel that revolves around indie games, let me know! I'm new to this kind of thing so any tips are welcome.
Thanks for reading this text, and if you have feedback/tips/questions/requests don't hesitate to tell me!

IndieGaming,"I have been reading this forum for a while now, and I thought it might be helpful to share my experiences with other new devs.

&amp;nbsp;

About a year ago my brother and I decided to do things different and slowly turn to game development. We have been building websites and programming other stuff for a long time now and we wanted to do something a bit more challenging.

  &amp;nbsp;  

We started off with 2 projects. One small arcade game to test the game dev world and a second larger, more complex project (we will be showing it to Reddit in a short while from now).  &amp;nbsp;  The first project was finished around Christmas and I was quite proud of our achievement. We had made a remake of the C64 game Hover Bovver. Unfortunately, the game was nowhere nearly as well received as I hoped to it to be. The first day it had only 150 downloads on iOS and from then it had a maximum of 5 or so downloads per day on average. Right now the total number of iOS downloads is stuck at 580 units. Android was bit better and is now at 2500 downloads. Using Unity Ads we have made a total of $12 over the past 4 months.

  &amp;nbsp;  

**What went wrong?**  
- We released the game for iPad only initially, because it was easier to do one device at the time. You only get featured once in the new games section and that is your only shot to get exposure in the app store.   
- We didn't do any advertising at all prior to launch. I expected everyone to look for games the way I do myself: browsing the appstore to see what is new.  
- We did not implement any form of social media into the game. I hate being asked to login via Facebook, so I decided not to add it into the game. I underestimated how important it is.   
- Appstore screenshots were initially boring shots of the game in action. They reflected the game properly, but you really have to smuck it up for people to notice it. Once I replaced the old screenshots, downloads went up a bit.  
- I am a gamer and I like difficult games. However, I overestimated the average gamer. People have a hard time doing things you consider trivial and most people will walk away from a challenge. I had to really cut the difficulty of the game down to accommodate the average gamer. Broke my heart, really.   
- We ignored Twitter completely. I dislike Twitter, but it is very useful to get the first few downloads you need to get higher into the app store.  
- No website. I did not have the energy left to also build a decent website for our new company. A place for people to discuss the game might have helped.  
- No fancy demo. I placed a video of the game play on Youtube, but nothing that really lures people into downloading the game.   
- No sticky factor. There isn't really a reason to come back to the game after playing it.   
- No Kickstarter. Even if you don't need the money, Kickstarter seems to be a good tool for devs to get exposure to their game. You might end up with a few fans even with a failed Kickstarter.
  
&amp;nbsp; 
 
**What went right?**  
&amp;nbsp;
- I spent a lot of time designing the levels and I spent around Euro 1000 on graphics. People generally like the game's appearance.  
- The game is somewhat unique. It is not a another clone of game X. I have not yet found any game with similar game play apart from the original.  
- Development time was relatively short. It took us about 3 months to completely design and implement the game.   
- The game is almost bug free. I made a mess of the code eventually (the game is built with UnityScript which allows you to do basically whatever you want. I have switched to C# to force myself to work neater).  

&amp;nbsp;
  
All in all we lost a good deal of money on the game and a lot of time we could have spent creating websites or software for others. Still, we are going through with our other project. We have learned a great deal about designing and programming and one failure should not keep you from trying to reach your goal. We are addressing most of the things we did wrong for our next project and even if this project was a total failure, I am still proud of the game we made.

I am thinking to build this project and to ask for financial support from different orgasnisation. We would need experienced programmers/def and graphic people, I already have a few contacts that are hyped by this project.

The development would not start soon, we need to have a full bill of specifications, we need to discuss it clearly and have a clear structure to work it out. If one of this step isn't matched, the project won't start.

I want to do it properly! So if you are interested or you ahve question don't hesitate to post them or pm me. If you have any advice,I would be gald to hear them! If you just want to say good luck, well I am glad anyway :D

Thx for reading,

I'm one of the developers from [Team Jolly Roger](http://www.teamjollyroger.com/) and I'm proud to say that our first big PC game, Interplanetary, has finally been released out of Early Access and into the real world!

We've been working on Interplanetary actively since 2013. We managed to get greenlit on Steam by the end of that year, and have been on Early Access since April 2014. Now, with the help of all the testers and players, we've finally completed version 1.0 and released it.

**Interplanetary**

Interplanetary is a scifi turn-based artillery strategy game. Each player controls their own planet, developing its infrastructure and building massive interplanetary artilleries. The goal is to wipe the enemy civilizations off the face of the universe, and what better way to do that than hurling massive rocks at each other?

The game combines base building and artillery game elements. The key to success is managing to target your weapons at the enemy planets, avoiding the orbital bodies' gravity or using it to your advantage.

IndieGaming,"Game Title: Super Jet City

I've been working on a head to head shared screen multiplayer game on and off for a little while and one of the biggest problems I have is that it's very hard for me to get enough people to play it. It's really intended for 4 people to play at once and the most I've managed is myself and one other.

I was hoping if anyone is willing, and has a PC, a buddy, and two Controllers (more is better, although I don't think having two PCs would really help), if you wanted to check it out and give feedback, any at all, it would be immensely helpful to me. After-all, flying around killing non-moving characters really isn't an effective means of gauging enjoyment levels.

I don't have much in the way of media to share at the moment but here are some screens to give an idea of how it looks / plays:
[Gameplay1](http://www.thedylankelly.com/images/SuperjetHighway.png)

[Menus](http://www.thedylankelly.com/images/SuperjetRanks.png)
[Menus](http://www.thedylankelly.com/images/SuperjetMenu.png)

A quick about the game:
The game is round based deathmatch. You get a point for each kill you score and the game ends when the first player reaches the kill limit. You fly around with your jetpack using the left analog stick and aim your weapon with the right. Currently their are 3 levels and 4 different weapons. Each round, a weapon is randomly picked from the selection of selected weapons and all players start with the same weapon. Weapons range from very practical to very impractical to keep the gameplay unpredictable. Every weapon is a one hit kill and rounds are fast and deadly. 

If you're interested in checking it out you can download it here (138MB): 
http://www.thedylankelly.com/SuperJetCity/SuperJetCity.rar
And as mentioned, you need at least 2 controllers to play. Xbox 360 and Xbox One work, others may but are untested.

IndieGaming,"I'm developing a game about space battles where spaceships bots will folow lines of three tactics out of dozens possible ones. the number  of ships in battle ranges from 2 to 30. Now I'm looking for new ideas of possible tactics Perhaps, you have any ideas?

I've divided all tactics in two base groups - attack and defence. As regards  attack tactics, I've already made:

* **1. Base attack:** ships moves to the closest enemy, hits it, flyaway to random direction if too close to the target;
* **2. Chasing tactics:** ship tries to attack from behind - finds suitable target and chase it. Flyaway only if target heads to the ship and collision is possible;

Planned attack tactics:

* **3. Hit&amp;Run tactics:** ship promptly and intensively fires with all weapons, then recharge energy til the end of round;
* **4. Sniper tactics:** ship attack distant targets using rare but powerful shots, tries to avoid close combat;
* **5. Kamikaze tactics:** ship looks for superior target and heads to it to explode it (suggested by [robertpaulson00](http://www.reddit.com/user/robertpaulson00) );


Plans regarding Defence tactics:

* **1. Base defence:** ship activates shields after first damage and deactibates some time after the last shot or after energy is empty.
* **2. Smart Defence:** Shops activate shields relevant to attack direction (fromnd. side, down, etc) or attacked equipment (engines, weapon, CPU, etc). Everything else like in 1 case.
* **3. Dance-dance tactics:** rapid changes in velocity and movement 
directions
* **4. Repairing tactics:** ships uses energy to repair some  share of damaged armor and equipment
* **5.Chameleon tactics** reduce ships visibility and radar/weaapon detection. Good choice in conjunction with the sniper attack tactics ",SpaceBot tactis ideas

We started back in august 2014 and had to work on it with university going on at the same time. I would really like if some of you could try it out and tell us your opinion on what is good and what is to improve on the game.

It is called Yubble and it is extremely simple, but can become quite challenging. The only thing you have to do is to flip the switches to make way for the bubbles so that they can reach the container of the same color.

In the end, we decided not to use google play services for leaderboards and achievements. Do you think those features should have been implemented? Also, we added a few ads since this is a free game, but we are not sure what is a good amount. Do you think that they are too many ads, or not enough, or in place where they shouldn't be?

IndieGaming,"Remember Sonic the Hedgehog? You want to run fast, but at the same time, if you don't know the level, you could be running full steam into spikes.

I think if you could see further ahead, you could run faster with more confidence. This is where a fish eye lens comes in.

Around your player is the standard playing board, but only for 1/3 of the screen or so. Outward from this circle things progressively get scaled less and less. If done right, in my minds eye, it feels like it'd look really cool. Older computers wouldn't be able to handle the additional 50-100x as many objects on screen, but we're living in an age where that is no problem.

This platformer could get even more extreme by doing the standard zoom out method if you're travelling extremely fast.   So you could have like 300-10,000x as many objects on screen as a standard platformer.

I've heard a fish eye view is simply a camera setting in 3d platformers.

What would the code be like if you did it in a 2d platformer though.  I'm thinking it'd be non trivial.  Is there some way of first doing it in squares around your guy so you scaleX,scaleY of graphics would just change as it moves outward from the center square?

I'm actually personally not interested in writing a platformer game though I've had ideas on making a platform game maker like Little Big Planet.    The idea went along the lines of letting people share in the revenue for the game based on the levels they make.

We have repeatedly tried to contact them but they have stopped answering our communications and we have also learned that they are doing this with other developers. Check out this Reddit:

Hey guys, so if you don't already know, Qbeh-1 is in the [Indie Gala May-hem Mega Bundle.](https://www.indiegala.com/mayhem)

I have to say, this is like a Portal type game. You are the only person in this mysterious world, and you do puzzles to get to the next room. Your only objective is to get to the door.

There are some awesome scenes, you will stop and take screenshots. I am using one of the screenshots as my wallpaper right now.

Here is a really cool scene. The first one is the one I'm using as my wallpaper. http://imgur.com/a/IWUMA

Basically, you can pickup these red blocks, and you can only place them on yellow blocks. You have to place them in a way that lets you climb, or walk across, or jump onto them. As long as you get to the exit.

This is pretty easy, I've only played the first world though. The hardest part is trying to get these orange pyramids. They are hidden pretty well. The first level was the hardest to find, because there was this jump that I didn't know I could make. It was a long jump, so I didn't think that was it. But the game doesn't go off course at all, so I knew it lead to something. Turns out there was a pyramid in there.

Anyways, really simple and beautiful game. The soundtrack is great and the graphics are fantastic. As someone who was late to the Portal party but ended up loving it, I love this game. I played Portal 1 and 2 in a single weekend, and I was hooked. This is a more relaxed version. The levels can be solved in under 15 minutes. 6 levels per world, 6 worlds total (5 worlds in the campaign and a bonus world after the credits).

There are no cut scenes or tutorials, just game. There is no text, the HUD can be disabled and you don't really need the crosshair. All in all, a beautiful game. Never played a game like this.

Here is an album of the game. I also included one of the puzzles. There are multiple puzzles per level, around 3-5 per level.

I also did a Steam review, pretty much talking about the same things. Here is a cut and paste if you'd like to read that as well.

**Steam Review**

One of the best games I've played in a while. I love this game. It is a Portal like game, but without portals. You are the only being in this mysterious world, and your objective is to get to the exit in each room. 

Now, after beating the first world, I realized I only picked up one pyramid. I went back to level 1 to start finding the other 5 in the first world, and I have to say, they are really tricky to get to. They are usually in a hidden room that you won't normally see. Now those made the game for me!

The game is good at leading you in the right direction, except for the pyramids, those are a lot harder to find. But to simply get to the exit, you can usually just follow the paths and do the jump puzzles.

Basically, you pick up these red blocks and use them to get to places. You can climb them, walk across them, create stairs, whatever you need, as long as you have enough. There are climbing puzzles where there is a huge wall, and you have to somehow climb up to the edge. 

I love the graphics, I love the music, I love the atmosphere, I love the Portal like world. You are the only being, and you are trying to simply get to the end of each level. 

When I say these graphics are better than COD, I mean it. I know that's a joke that goes around, but I was shocked to see these graphics on Very High with MSAA turned on. Advanced Warfare was a million dollar game and doesn't look as good as this. ",Qbeh-1 The Atlas Cube. Review and screenshots below.

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project

IndieGaming,"I remember about 2-3 years ago, there was this program called Tiggit. It was basically a program that allowed the user to download, install, and launch a plethora of free/indie games and demos.

Nowadays, the official website (tiggit.net) is down, and if I try downloading from the Sourceforge page, it doesn't work, as it needed an archive file from the website.

So I have three questions:

1. Does anyone else remember this program?

2. What happened to it?

3. Is there any alternative?",What Happened To Tiggit?
IndieGaming,I remember an indie game that I saw last summer. It was in early alpha. If featured a black main character (like shadow black) and it had checkpoints and combat that reminded me of dark souls.

So Reddit, i'm asking you, do you think pixel art is here to stay or do you prefer a different style. e.g vector art",Modern pixel art
IndieGaming,"Hey IndieGaming,

I'm attempting my second game, after becoming bored and putting off the completion of my cookie-cutter ""I can make a survival crafting game too"" game, [Homesteads](http://gamejolt.com/games/rpg/homesteads/27973/) which, surprisingly, got very good ratings, considering absolutely no footage or gameplay was released.  

Anywho, I'm going a different route entirely with this next one. I'm making (well, attempting to make, anyhow) a mostly text-based dungeon crawler in an ever-expanding, randomly generated (text) universe. Every time you start a new game, the entire thing will be different. New town names, new NPC's, new quests, new enemies, new loot, etc.  

It's something that's been done before, but here's the kicker - it's online co-op. However, it wont be random online co-op, since this game will play much like DnD. It would be hard to keep playing the same save without the other random person. So, you'll have to join a specific friend.  

Moving on from that, I need ideas for this medieval fantasy-type universe. Ideas that are different. I don't want every enemy you encounter to be a boring orc or a goblin, but I also don't want them to be a flailing mass of tentacles with 5 nipples and a human foot named Carl. I want them to be believable enemies in a fantastical universe (reptilian variants, snakes monsters and such..or even bird variants, gryphon type monsters).  

Bottom line is, I need some help getting this universe together so everything can have a name. I'll also (probably) end up setting variables for every random generated thing in the game, so that you can essentially reskin (retext?) the game to be a different universe. Say you wanna play it in a Fallout universe? Ok, rename all the enemies as Fallout enemies, rename the factions as Fallout factions, etc.  

Anyways, if you have any ideas, please post them below or PM me. The biggest chunk of this project will be designing and creating this random world and I'm not as creative as I like to think.

4. Am I able to upload my rules?  Tutorial video?  How would people know how to play and I how can make it easy for new players to try?

5. How would I ""publish"" my game and make it available to the TTS community?  Is that fairly straightforward?

I always buy my games on sale, as I don't have too much money to spend on games. My budget (and my computer's performance) is quite low.


So, would Dungeon Defenders, Braid, Risk of Rain, and Antichamber be worth the extra $4.89 to get the entire bundle? Or should I get only the BTA? I already have Limbo and might trade it or give it away.

I'd also like some suggestions for other indie games. I've got a couple things on my [wishlist](http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomnerdgeek/wishlist) already. Thanks in advance for any responses!

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project

For the past year and a half, we've been working on a college themed fighting game called Duel Major and we just launched our Steam Greenlight campaign, so we'd love it if you guys wanted to take a look at what we've done so far and maybe even give us a vote.

------------------------------------------
DUEL MAJOR is an Platform-Fighting Game where players duke it out as personifications of college majors, battle to stay out of debt and earn their degree! 

Inspired by the Super Smash Bros. Series, Duel Major seeks to bridge the gap between casual-oriented and intense fighting games. Our focus is to offer simplified and interesting move sets and mechanics that allow for emergent depth, rather than inherent complexity. By removing typically over-centralizing mechanics, and giving every attack/action more versatility, Duel Major will provide low barrier to entry for people new to the fighting game genre, and enough emergent complexity to engage more advanced players.

IndieGaming,"Hello,

Throne and Crown boasts:  
1) Action + RPG which is a solid game style. The action means you need to think and react to situations. The RPG means if you're not good enough to do the action the first time around, eventually you'll level up enough to assist you through it. The game plays like 2d Gauntlet/2d Zelda with an overland.

2) There are places to explore and colorful NPCs to meet.

3) The music score impressed just about everyone. I had three musicians sign on to contribute!

4) There are three bosses. There is the Ratiator, the King Crab, and the Goblin King. Aside from my beta tester Ben and myself, no one has beaten the Goblin King.

5) There is a village to help and you can log in daily to help them or you can push through and collect resources yourself by exploring and gathering.

6) There is a ""stealth"" zone on the beach which is fun, and has island rhythms.

7) The game is designed to be expansive and episodic. Each episode should add new features and a new town to rescue. I really want to make new levels, a castle sim, a roguelike mode, multiplayer and army vs army combat. 

8) As a serious video game player for 35 years, I personally enjoy playing this game. It has the features that I enjoy in a game. I'd be really excited if this game takes off so I can keep making future episodes for the next couple years. If this game doesn't take off at all though, I'm going to keep making video games.

9) I feel the future of Android action games is joystick and keyboard, so I've provided a way to play with either joystick or keyboard if you plug one in.

10) Good guy friendly. There are options to be morally grey, but following the path of being the good guy is optimal.

11) This game is 100% beatable without any virtual goods! I've done it myself. This is not a pay to win game. I'm a video game purist and one of the good guys. I just want people to have fun playing my video games. I'm in it for the fun. If I get money, all it does is let me keep making games for the long haul. I have over 30 games I have ideas for making moving forward. Let me know if you want to hear about them.

IndieGaming,"hey everyone, I've never posted here, so hopefully I'm doing this right

recently I've been making music on my computer for some of my friends' projects (amateur / for school), and at this point I'm sort of looking to take it elsewhere, just not sure how to go about it.

I'm still willing to work for free, maybe help people on phone games or something, maybe build a resume, does anyone know how I could maybe start to get involved in something like that?

the stuff I make is still kinda cheesy, I don't think I could do full orchestra crazy ass AAA soundtracks, but I can do some stuff that's a bit more old school/indie-ish, which is why I came here.

here's one I made for an 8-bit beat-em-up that never got finished https://soundcloud.com/djsirgold/shark-fight-chapter-1

here's one I did for a student game that also isn't finished, but you jump around and grab coins and stuff https://soundcloud.com/djsirgold/jumpjump

---
I am the sole developer for Ablyvion Games and I am proud to release my first title, *FuseBall*.  This game was born out of my desire to create an original take on short session gameplay utilizing a control system that is simple yet intuitive.  *FuseBall* is controlled entirely by tilting left/right (a la *Doodle Jump*) however instead of influencing one character your movements influence the physics and therefore everything on the screen, like so:

[*FuseBall* User Experience GfyCat](http://gfycat.com/SmugHoarseConure)

The game itself is ""endless"" although the spawn rate increases slowly with time so no game will go on forever.  A particularly high scoring game may reach the three minute mark but many games end earlier.

Ultimately my goal when making the game was that within the hectic chaos of colorful balls flying all around the screen, the controls always feel ""right.""  The fun lies in the layers of fluid motion extending from bouncing balls on the screen out to the user themselves.

*FuseBall* is **free** to download, ad-supported, and has no in-app purchases.  It is available starting today for Android on the [Google Play Store](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ablyvion.FuseBall).  It was developed with Unity and I'm working on fine tuning the code for iOS (and fine tuning my budget for the large app store/have to own a mac price tags) and if all goes well hope to release for iOS in September.

IndieGaming,"Hi, Martin here, an indie game developer from 2 men team. Currently is developing an abstract strategy game. The game is real-time and we have done tons of testing with internal testers (they are actually real life close friends) for 1 years.

Few weeks ago, We presented the alpha version to some audiences in a local small game fair. After playing, they said the game is quite fun to play but is better to be turn based, so there will be no time pressure and can think as much as strategy they can.

So we start prototyping the turn based version of this game, then let the internal testers to test play. But all of them have found that the feel and gaming experience is totally different from the real-time. And they all prefer real-time.

So I suddenly have some thoughts: 
* Many new players prefer turn based at first, but once they enjoy the real-time excitement, they will stick to real-time. 
* If my first thought is true, how to educate new player to accept the ""time pressure"" is actually part of fun of strategy game?

Alright, so would like to ask you all: - What is your preference? Real-time or turn based strategy games?","For strategy games, real-time or turn based?"

We're three friends that developed an Android game as a part of a course on mobile development. We decided to continue working on the game to try and really make it fun and we believe it's finally starting to get pretty addictive. 

We're fans of the gameplay from Meteos for Nintendo DS. We noticed that there aren't any real options for the mobile market to play such a fast-paced puzzle game so we decided to recreate it for our project. Then we started to see that the mobile platform has some differences from Nintendo DS so we had to make a few of our own changes and twists to the original gameplay. Our game is called SWAP because you, well, swap blocks a lot. We used some lib GDX as the game engine but most of it is just java hacking. 

The game is accessible from the Google Play Store for no charge, we just hope you give it a chance and enjoy! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blokk.game.android

Hey guys,

I've been working professionally in AAA games for my adult life on titles like Gears of War and Kinect Star Wars, and am currently a lead game designer on HoloLens. Then in the evenings, I've been doing a side project for the last couple years with friends as a more relaxed creative outlet. Today marks the day when we're finally putting out our first trailer, and I wanted to get some feedback on it, as well as the game itself.

So, without further adieu, I'd like to present- **Spellcaster Adventure.**

On this project I am the lead designer/coder/producer whatever. Our team is about 5 core people, plus quite a few friends that help out here and there. 

Inspired by games like Dungeon Raid and Puzzle quest, we set out to build a beautiful RPG puzzle hybrid, with a few major principles-

* We wanted it to be in realtime
* Not rely on difficulty levels for balance
* Be fun and competitive for both newbs and masters to the genre
* Offer an interesting single player campaign that isn't all procedural (there's a storyyyy)
* Go full premium, meaning high quality art/audio with no f2p mechanics or money sinks. 

Really we just wanted to make the best real-time word search game ever.

This is the first time we've ever solicited for feedback, so I'd love to hear whatever you have to say.

IndieGaming,"I came across this article titled [Procedural vs. Randomly Generated Content in Game Design](http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JoshBycer/20150807/250760/Procedural_vs_Randomly_Generated_Content_in_Game_Design.php) and it made me think about level design from a gamer's perspective. I've spoken with several fellow developers who prefer designing their levels on their own instead of using procedural or random generation.

While procedural generation helps give a game more replay value, these designers feel that procedurally generated levels tend to lack the personal craftsmanship that can make a level's design unique and meaningful.

As gamers, do you prefer one over the other? Or, do certain games cater to one or the other?",Traditional level design VS procedural level design?

IndieGaming,"We are 3 students that made a game called Bloodshed. Bloodshed was developed as a final grade project in the time left between studies and our internship work. It was or first 'big' project, took several months and we learned a lot. 

The most common way people describe Bloodshed is ""Hotline Miami"". And, indeed, we took a lot of references from HM, because we love the games, but we wanted it to be more 'old-style' shooter, where you could resist more shots, get healthpacks, fight tons of enemies at a time... and less 'try and die'. We also added the possibility of destroying props like tv's (I swear, we had this before HM2 was released!), barrels...

So we ended up having one of the bests projects in our school and now have the chance to attend the Madrid Games Week as developers. There's a contest with other projects where the most voted will win, and thats where we need your help!

So, I'd love video game recommendations!  Here are some criteria (not set in stone so feel free to rec anything, but guideline-type things)

* A short game (2-10 hour story if there is a story, roughly that timeframe to enjoy a full game experience if there's not a linear story)

* A relatively inexpensive game (15 dollars, more is pushing it)

* A game that might be able to result in some interesting discussion.

We all have different tastes in games (I prefer roguelikes, someone else enjoys puzzles, someone else loves exploration, someone else likes action/shooters) so pretty much any genre is good, as we're all trying to branch a little outside of our comfort zones as well.

Games that we've played and therefore will not be using as book club games: Binding of Isaac, SMB, Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy, Darkest Dungeon, Gone Home, Game Dev Tycoon, Long Live The Queen, The Cave, Psychonauts, Thomas Was Alone, To The Moon, Monaco, The Banner Saga, Papers Please, This War of Mine... there's probably a few more but those are what I can think of from the top of my head.

To quote the Kickstarter page: 

&gt;BattleCON, short for “Battle Connection Fighting System”, is a card-based duel between two fighters. BattleCON gives you a wide variety of unique tactics, and you'll combine these with strategic play to take down rivals in fast-paced duels.

* Steam (Mac and PC)        
* Android (yay)         
* iOS

&gt; In addition to being able to play anytime, anywhere, with anyone in the world, we want to bring you an exciting roster of characters, special costumes, and new play modes that bring the game and the world to life, including the long sought-after story and solo dungeon modes.

The game is called Judgement. It's a story-driven decision-making adventure game where your decisions impact that outcome of where the story goes, mixed in with some top-down combat here and there. I made the first version when I was an angsty 15-year old, and since then have teamed up with others and improved graphics and gameplay.

Here's a trailer I put together of the game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3XJ8ZtxE4c

If you are interested, please PM me or comment here. I'll send you a CD key that you can redeem on Steam. After you close the game it will open up a feedback form in your browser, *please, please fill it out*. Many ignored it last time and I missed out on a lot of potential feedback.

Cheers.

[Posted this about 10 days back. I hate reposting but this seemed to be the only place where I could actually find testers that would fill out the feedback form! I've taken previous feedback into account and I hope that everyone will find it favorably this time.

IndieGaming,"I'm in Tokyo for TGS 2015. I went to the first day (business day) and was surprised that I did not see any Japanese indie developers. There were quite a few developers from ASEAN countries, but where was the Japan representation?

Outside of the AAA publishers, it was pretty much just mobile app developers.

Is there really a strong indie scene in Japan? Is TGS not the best place to see Japanese indie gaming? Where do Japanese indie developers congregate?

IndieGaming,"This topic is bothering me for quite some time and I finally decided to learn what other redditors here think about it.

So, I personally know a few developers that used to post here about their games but stopped a long time ago. That's because of the ridiculous rules / moderation of /r/indiegaming


IMO this subreddit should be **a way for developers to directly interact with indie gamers**, but it's not. Anyone who wants to post about their game has to have at least 90% of posts not about his stuff.
And I don't think it's reasonable to require that those developers spend their whole days searching and submitting posts about other games or indie gaming in general (though as I today experienced comics about indie games are also being removed from here so I dunno what else except for trailers of someone else's games can be posted here)

And I have often seen some cool stuff posted by the devs here that gets deleted after an hour by the mod even though being at ~60+ points in that short time.


So anyways, I guess my question here is: how do you want to learn about new games that are being developed? Because nowadays indie devs don't have that many options to actually show their work anywhere (and yeah, there are a lot of groups on facebook and what else but they get hundreds of posts each hour so that's not really a viable way).

I remember maybe over a year ago it wasn't so strict here, I don't quite know what was the reason to change it but I think it was a bad decision.


Also I hope I can learn what you guys think without this post getting removed.",Can we discuss the rules / moderation of this subreddit?

IndieGaming,"Hey guys,

Our team is working on visual novel and I'm trying to figure out what the best way is to release it. Visual novels do not have a big fanbase compared to other genres. Currently I'm not sure if I should go for Steam(Huge player base), the Humble widget(placed on own website, generates Steam keys.) or itch.io. 

I'm leaning towards the Humble widget. It allows me to put it as Pay What You Want with a suggested price on your own wevsite. I feel like it would look more professional. However, they always have to pay something so it might scare people away who are looking for a free game. Itch.io has a PWYW option with free as minimum. I think it really matters if people have to pay(even if it's 0.01$) or if it's free. 
The Humble widget also takes care of crowdfunding reward distribution afaik.(I'm planning on starting a patreon)

My main aim is to get as many people as possible to play the game. Money is not a priority. 

So what would you do in my position? How do people release their indie games nowadays?

I also hear a lot of people saying that they don't want to play ""free/PWYW games"" as they leave an impression of it being a ""cheaply produced"" game. What do you guys think of this?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I saw that itch.io has his own widget as well. This way I can release the game on itch.io and steam for free while having it on my own website as well. There are two things I noticed though. Steam asks 100$ for submitting your game? This is kind of surprising. Also, paypal asks 30 cents fee per transaction on itch.io.

#MOUSE CONTROL

Our game is 100% mouse-controlled. Moving the mouse moves your character directly, just like it moves your mouse cursor in any other application.

We use that to create unique attacks like our signature [star dash](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55244e87e4b04f1005faa0eb/55f0e1cfe4b007043f8051be/55f0e55ee4b0d6287c837d3a/1441850740071/GifCapture-201509091545186628.gif), where you click and drag *through* enemies rather than hanging back and shooting. (Of course, we have plenty of [shooting](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55244e87e4b04f1005faa0eb/55f0e1cfe4b007043f8051be/55f0e5a5e4b0ac1456bcbac6/1441850807689/GifCapture-201509091547365714.gif) too!)

Confused? We made an [explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJm1hbU-CdM) to show it in action.

#DYNAMIC PATTERNS

We're hand-crafting hundreds of [enemy patterns](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55244e87e4b04f1005faa0eb/55f0e1cfe4b007043f8051be/55f0e472e4b0d6287c837883/1441850493381/GifCapture-201509091530391461.gif), but each time you play a given level we shuffle which patterns are actually spawned.

You'll get to know the ""tells"" for each pattern and how to beat it, but you'll never know which patterns are coming up next. We think that keeps things way more engaging for long-term play.

We really hope you won't pass on us just because our funding percentage is low right now. You can help us get it higher! :D

If we don't fund, we'll probably have to cut our scope way down and try to release ASAP. We're not down to our last pennies just yet, but without additional funding we'll have a pretty limited amount of time to finish.

#ABOUT US

I'm Josh Sutphin, an 11-year game industry veteran. You wouldn't know my earlier games, but later I was a designer on [Warhawk](http://warhawk.com) and lead designer on [Starhawk](http://starhawkthegame.com), both for PS3, and I won [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo) back in 2010 with a silly RTS-thing called [Fail-Deadly](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&amp;uid=2073) (updated version [here](http://www.third-helix.com/faildeadly.html)). I founded [Kickbomb Entertainment](http://kickbomb.us) in early 2013 and started [Legacy of the Elder Star](http://elderstargame.com) late that same year. I do all our design, code, writing, and [music](https://soundcloud.com/invicticide/sets/legacy-of-the-elder-star).

My artist, Erik, isn't a redditor; in fact, he spends way more time *offline* than I do, and he's probably healthier for it. He developed his art style while living in the mountains and hanging with snowboarders for most of the last decade, and I think that non-games influence has actually been a really good thing for us.

#QUESTIONS?

Hit me with 'em. ;)

And actually, I have a question to throw back at the community: have any of you seen another game that controls like ours? I feel like our 1:1 mouse control – and our star dash attack in particular – may actually be one-of-a-kind, since I can't find anything else that works this way... but I also find that kind of hard to believe, since there's like a squillion games out there and more being made every day. We can't possibly be first on the scene with this... can we? O_o

We just launched our Steam Greenlight page not long ago and would like to encourage everyone to take a look and and see whether our game looks interesting to you.
***
**GAME DESCRIPTION**


The Enchanted Forest and its animal denizens are under siege. The invaders are a marauding army of fierce reptiles whose unopposed ruthlessness will destroy the Forest. Meanwhile, an evil wizard has kidnapped the king and queen and has them imprisoned in his dark castle. The only hope for the forest dwellers is Rynn, a spry young fox who also happens to be their princess. Rynn’s mental and physical agility, along with power gained from magical fruit, will allow her to halt the siege and defeat the evil wizard.


Rynn’s Adventure is a 2D platformer game in which the player guides Rynn through a variety of environments teeming with magic and danger. The player will help Rynn combat the many enemies she encounters and outwit each of their fearsome generals. Rynn will eventually face off against the evil wizard himself in order to free her parents and ultimately save the Enchanted Forest and its inhabitants.


Choose which level to play in any order. Use Rynn’s impressive acrobatic maneuvers to overcome obstacles and enemies alike. Confront challenging bosses waiting at the end of each level. Unlock fabulous power-ups for each boss defeated.

#Heist Night

Heist Night is a two player asymmetrical stealth action game in which one player will play as a **thief** trying to steal valuables in a museum, and escape unscathed. The other player controls the **two guards** and tries to capture the thief before he/she escapes with the museum’s precious objects. 

Heist Night offers two vastly different types of gameplay that interplay with each other. It offers **first person stealth action** gameplay for the thief, and **real-time strategy** gameplay for the guards.

##Features:
* 2 vastly different play styles in 1 game: **first person stealth** *versus* **top-down real-time strategy**.

* Unique asymmetrical gameplay.
* [Original score](https://soundcloud.com/mythili/sets/heist-night-ost) arranged and composed by [Mythili Mahendran](http://mythilimahendran.com/MYTHILI_MAHENDRAN___COMPOSER/index.html).

We initially made this game for a university course called GameLab, where we were challenged to create a game in 14 work days; with 11 people. After the course ended however, we continued to polish the game till the current state.

We are still looking to continue developing the game even further by adding additional levels, for you to play in.

Last week, I shared [Chill Quest](http://www.chillquest.com) with you and got some [really great feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/3npviw/hi_there_i_just_released_my_first_game_chill/) regarding the narrative design. (I also ran afoul of your mods for not following the rules - whoops!) I've made a couple changes and wanted to share the latest version.

A major part of the game is a ""can quest"" where users search for 5 cans. In the last version I shared, 4 of the cans were scattered around, while the fifth was the reward for a long quest. Based on feedback, I made all five cans the reward for individual, small quests, making the journey more intuitive and consistent. I also added a can count to the HUD.

You can also now interact with the dogs. They'll bark and restore your chill.

Finally, I deactivated conversations with non-stationary npc's, as many people found that frustrating.

Anyway, thanks so much! Like I said last time, this is my first game, and the positive feedback you gave me is really encouraging!",[SP Game] - Update: Thanks for the great feedback to Chill Quest. I've made a couple changes

IndieGaming,"I am an 18 yo who is gonna attend computer science this year. and i'm self learning Java programming lang. 

i always have thought that making games is only a big company business with a lot of employees. but recently i found about the indie games genre and i was surprised that the nice MOBA game Archeblade was made by only 6 people. and it was an indie one. although the team stopped supporting the game but it's still running on steam for free. also there is an MMO called project d online was made by just 1 man!

so i'd like to make a question to any one who encouraged in the indie gaming industry, which is: What does it take to make a descent indie game?

now before anyone tells me ""it depends on the game you'd like to make"" i'd like to narrow my question to good games with 3D modelings and objects. whether it's an FPS or MMO or driving game.

i already read about the funding issues that any indie developing team might face. so i want the discussion to be about the actual team structure. what kind of skills is needed to form a capable team? what else besides a programming language do i have to master in order to play a role in the team? and how can i utilize it in making a game?

IndieGaming,"Hi guys!
I am starting out as a translator (Portuguese &gt; English and English &gt; Portuguese) and I figured this would be an appropriate place to start.

I've always had a great passion for reading and playing videogames but this started before I was introduced to English, thus I felt there was a barrier I could not surpass unless there were Portuguese translations as that was my mother language.

The idea of being a professional translator started growing on me and i got more and more interested. Finally, I decided to build a career in this area. At the moment I am interested in developing my skills with foreign languages as a translator while searching for new opportunities.


I was kind of hoping someone could point me in the right direction. 

If someone has a game which i can translate to Portuguese so I can start building up my portfolio, please contact me!

Hi! I'm co-owner and Chief Bear Logician (programmer) of Bear Logic Labs, a 2-man studio out of Sioux Falls, SD. After leaving our previous jobs we struck out together to make a living and have fun at the same time. We want to build engaging games with our own twisted sense of humor. We're turning to Kickstarter to help with the release of our card collection defense strategy game. (I know what you're thinking, there are no micro-transactions, just the one-time purchase of the game.)

**Cards of the Citadel**

Cards of the Citadel is a 2D deck-based tactical defense game. Draw cards and use them to summon powerful defenses and minions to fight off waves of enemies. 

Choose from two different factions with vastly different playstyles. The Human faction favors static defenses. Summon mighty ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets to form an impenetrable defensive line. Send your infantry to the slaughter and pelt the enemy with fireballs to support your fortifications. The Gnomes are the tinkers of the realm. They rely on their autonomous mechanical creations to match the enemy's numbers. Send waves of suicidal explosive spiderbots and create mighty golems to meet the enemy head-on.

**We need your help!**

Hello!

I run an art crticism and philosophy blog over at TheGemsbok.com. Every Wednesday, I publish a review or analysis of a different video game under the heading of [Your Mid-week Mission](http://thegemsbok.com/video-game-reviews-mid-week-mission/).

Although the series was headed with a description about games from all eras and all platforms, all five of the articles which have gone up so far have concerned indie games from the last five years, and it looks like most of my upcoming posts will be in that same category. I guess my interests have trumped my intentions, at least for the time being.

My posts run the gamut from simple recommendations or criticisms all the way to full-blown literary analyses.

Below I have linked some examples of my different types of posts. Please click on one if you find the title intriguing, and see if you like my style and taste.

Anyways, I would love some feedback so I can keep trying to get better at this whole game development thing.  

Some key points I learned while making it.  Inventory systems can be simple or complex.  I took something simple and hard coded the hell out of it.  I learned a lot though, mostly though mistakes I made.  Unity is wonderfully, but very very overwhelming.  From the UI drag and drop, to the code, there are hundreds of ways to do one thing and without a doubt something I need to study more on.  Single Responsibility Principal, or SRP, something I remember reading about when I used to code in Actionscript 3.0.  I really need to learn to make each class focus on one thing, and not spaghetti code everything.  
   
   
Well that sums up a little bit of my adventure, I do hope you guys enjoy it and have some solid feedback for me!  Oh and as for time frame: 2.5 months of development.  LOTS of off and on.

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Made in Unity, using a lot of assets from the Asset Store. It allowed us to put together a nice looking game, even with such little amount of time dedicated to art. I was actually the artist on the project, so my task was to take a lot of the assets and make them more cohesive to what we wanted.

You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp8mqg9rafu7dx3/Here%20Runs%20Santa%20Claus%20Setup.exe?dl=0) if you want to give it a whirl. It will install the game, as well as .NET Client 4.0 if you don't have that, and the XNA 4.0 redistributable (which is only a few megs, if i recall correctly).

Like I said, I'd love to get a wide range of people trying it and giving me some feedback.

The game is a challenging but rewarding top-down game that asks you to navigate levels at top speed while performing actions such as Distracting Guards, Opening Doors, Pickpocketing, Dashing through Windows and more...

Sprinter has a very unique dynamic soundtrack that interacts with the player as they play, and builds to a crescendo as you progress through each chapter.

Hi I'm the artist/animator for Floor Boy Games upcoming game Ready, Aim, Fish! Releasing on Nov 18th. We are a small three person dev from Melbourne, Australia, we've been working on our upcoming game for the past 6 months are in the last steps till release. We hope you find something interesting and follow us in the future! The game comes out for IOS on the 18th.
____
**A little about the game:**

Ready, Aim, Fish is an intense arcade fishing game for the iPhone where you hunt for bizarre fish using a computerized harpoon gun. Aim carefully to catch multiple fish in a side on lake view. Reel your catch in by quickly swiping the command prompts of your computerised harpoon gun. Earn fame and gold as you explore, catch and sell your fish in the rugged lakes of Shiverpine Mountain.

**Features of Ready, Aim, Fish:**

- 45 insanely weird and wonderful fish that all have a set of randomly created fins, tails and flair. All varying in value!
- Upgrades for your harpoon gun, sonar and boat!
- Awesome old school pixel art style!
- 4 Different lakes that have rare and unique fish
- Addictive and simple aiming, shooting and reeling gameplay!
- Chill and groovy soundtrack!

**Why we made this game:**

We decided to create a game that will have a lot of design challenges to overcome. Fishing games have a lot of flawed design traps as they attempt to capture real life fishing. They seem to follow this pattern: ""Cast fishing line, wait, see a generic looking fish, wait, doesn’t take bait, wait, tug line, wait, takes the bait randomly, reel in by holding joystick in opposite direction of the fish” They just seem to be boring and too random.

The sole focus on the game is on one road cutting diagonally through the screen. Vehicles travel up and down the road at varying speeds and you must run across the road and back as many times as you need. The aim is to ALMOST get hit but not actually get hit. The faster the vehicle you dodge is travelling or the larger it is, the more points you get. If you get taken out by a vehicle, the game is over. 

Game consists of 6 current themes, and with more planned for release with each update of the game.

First off, this is NOT my game. It was made by my roommate and her Game Design class group, but I'm posting on her behalf because I use Reddit and she does not. They've been working on this all semester, gone through beta testing, and are ready to unleash their game on the world! Note: their grades are based almost entirely on how many people play their game, so if you happen to enjoy it please tell your friends!

**Clone Combat** is a free-to-play Flash web game. It's a puzzle platformer with an interesting twist: your character has a clone who mirrors your every move. And if you run into your clone, you die (rather horrifically I might add). The objective is to murder your clone via acid, dagger, or electrocution, without dying yourself. This means a lot of planning ahead for your own character as well as for the clone. It starts out simple enough but gets tricky!

Development on the game is pretty much over because, well, the semester is pretty much over too. But questions and feedback are more than welcome! Small fixes or even new levels might be added, especially if it gets popular-ish. My roommate did the art, but she and I will pass feedback on to the rest of the group, and we'll do our best to answer all questions.

IndieGaming,"Let's discuss the following perspective:

As a consumer, I would prefer to pay after I play. For one, I don't have to ""guess"" the value of the game to me; I can play it and then decide. If I don't have money to spend and I like the game, I can still support by providing feedback and sharing the game to others who can. 

As a developer, I love this model. I can be more open and honest with my community. I can distribute my games across a multitude of channels. I can extract value/help from anyone who enjoys my products, regardless of their financial position. Finally, advertisers win less. Although advertising is obviously still needed to reach anyone, the game will sell itself rather than an idea of the game. This results in more focus on quality product, and less on the ""idea"" of the product.  

Developers and consumers: what do you think? Can you get on board with either of these perspectives? Do you need to purchase at the point of distribution to be motivated to spend? Will developers from this perspective starve? Torrents, microtransactions, F2P, DLC, Pay What You Want; people seem to try this from a variety of angles. 

Lets hear it! 

P.S I'm going to argue and challenge everyone to promote discussion and paint the full picture. No one ever learned anything from a group of people agreeing.

I just wanted to share with you guys some cool games developed by Korean indies.  I had an opportunity to meet them at Gstar, the Korean game festival, and realized that they're not getting enough recognition as they should mainly because most of them don't speak English, so they have difficulty promoting their games on forums and whatnot or at big game shows like E3 or Gamescom.

Korean indie scene is dominated by mobile games since console and PC package games are almost non-existent in Korea, and F2P MMOs are on the downhill, but there are some cool PC (mostly on Steam) games as well.  

Anyhow, I thought the game were cool, and deserved more recognition so I'm sharing them here.  Check them out if you're interested.

IndieGaming,"My friend and I just launched a Greenlight campaign for a game we've been working on since 2009, to a surprisingly negative response. (We have realized that we played up the ambience and slow pace and those were probably not the best selling points for Steam and we should have played up the things like puzzles more)

Anyway, we realize that our traffic drops precipitously after falling off the first page, and we're kind of stuck at what to do next for marketing the game. We're quite proud of the game and we think it is a great game ourselves. Are there other marketing strategies we could try, or should we just accept the game as a marketing failure? And how do we distinguish between a marketing mistake and it just not being a game people are interested in?

I decided to make a discussion post and not mention or link to the actual game because I imagine this isn't an uncommon issue. Advice for game devs in this position?",Misstep on Greenlight launch... now what?

I'm looking for suggestions for my peekaboo game. The idea is to have two people collaboratively recognizing 3D objects. You can find the game [here](http://impressionist-amt.herokuapp.com/amt). While I set it up so that you can play against a computer, it's only fun (if any) when playing against another player. The challenge right now is to get two players to play about the same time...

So I wonder if this post can help me to get some people to try it out, both helping me to collect some game data and giving me suggestions on how to make the game more interesting.

[Steam Store Page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/412010)

&amp;nbsp;

Hey guys, 

I am one of the developers of ""Crossbow Warrior"".  
It is a classical platformer in 3D, that tells the story of William Tell, a real swiss Hero.  
As a teaser we created an 3D animated cinematic [here](https://youtu.be/BygaWtYADE4) which looks very cool.  

&amp;nbsp;

In short: ""Crossbow Warrior"" is about independence and revolution against nobility.
When playing ""Crossbow Warrior"" you are not limited to just the sidescroller perspective. There are additional modes such as Third-person and top-down levels, to spice things up.

&amp;nbsp;

Now we are facing our release on Steam, which will be on December 10th (So just one more week, yay!) and are currently trying to raise awareness for players who like a bit of a challenge!  


We put together 29 levels in different sceneries and wanted the game to have the touch of a retro platformer.  
That is why each level has varying difficulty to beat.  
Sometimes you have to handle several enemies at a time, sometimes you need fast reactions to run dodge obstacles and  sometimes patience and accuracy will make you continue down the path of ""Crossbow Warrior"".  


We thought of releasing it for 8,99 USD and the first week or so with a 15% discount.

The idea is this: Week-by-week or month-by-month (depending on the collective level of commitment) we will be playing a game that the group imagines will be somehow meaningful, thoughtful, inspirational, or intellectual.  The games will be short.  The games will be 'smart.' the games will be indie (usually.) The games will be discussion-worthy.

One game that is on my radar - and the game that the group will officially begin with - is [The Witness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMMKFX78x0).

Based on Blow's talks and previous work, we can easily assume this game will offer plenty in all of the above categories.  But before the game comes out, we will be playing and discussing a game or two to warm us up to this new format.

This game is a perfect die &amp; retry. Fast and smooth. The music is nice and worth listening to, and manages not to be repetitive even if, in fact, it is (if that makes sens), which is not common in this kind of game.

A bit hard, sure, but you can still see your learning curve and you can clearly feel the improvement and that's the most rewarding thing in this game because you won't win or unlock anything except self-esteem and pure satsifaction (actually you can unlock Super Velocibox which is an hardcore mode basically).

We are a small squad of enthusiastic developers from Saint-Petersburg, Russia.
And we are working on our first project - _Freemium Simulator_ game. We had already spent a bunch of a time (around ~600 hours) on it. Our 3D artist made about 100 models from scratch and there were a lot of fun actually during the whole development process. So we'd like to share our results with a community, since we are gamers too and we know it - how to be a gamer.

*****
##### Freemium Simulator? Really?

Well, yes. We are trying to make some irony about all these microtransactions, crates, cases, keys and treasures. Trading systems like Community Market, in-game purchases, idle servers and scammers - are these a thing now? Is this a real trend in a game industry now? So that is what _Freemium Simulator_ is about.
Player starts with a basic game account and tries to deal with all aspects of a freemium and f2p world. Base game mechanic represents a replica of a crate/case opening from the popular game titles like Valve's TF2 and CS:GO, the other abilities are - trading, crafting and a multiplayer interaction with other players (yes, we do have a server, so all data will be persistent).

##### What is next?

IndieGaming,"So! I have this great idea to run an after school meetup at our local library, a sort of self-styled ""Game Dev Cafe"". The basic idea is that it would be a place for people to meetup, discuss games, game mechanics, game development platforms, and just generally hang out and celebrate games. 

One part that I want to include in this is something like a book club, but for games. Since we are in the middle of a Golden Age of Indie Gaming (or the Indiepocalypse (to be debated in a future meeting)), it is very hard for my Hearthstone-addled brain to keep up on all the new content coming out; as such, I was hoping to crowd-source a shortlist of games that meet a fairly narrow list of criteria:

* The game must be free (or F2P, or have a solid trial experience)
* The game must be work-safe (So ""Rinse and Repeat"" is probably not going to be in our rotation)
* The game should be playable within a ten to fifteen minute window (or the player should be able to get the gist of the game within that timeframe)
* Ideally the game should feature a unique mechanic, narrative, or artistic element that merits discussion
* The game should also be playable on PC; we have a few game consoles, but tons of laptops. 

If you have a suggestion that doesn't quite meet one or two of the above criteria, go ahead and throw it out anyway!

In Voidspire Tactics, you control a party of 4 customizeable characters who are exploring a sort of alien-abductee pastiche universe; you might be in a cavern one moment, and on an alien landscape the next.

The meat and potatoes of the game consists of turn-based tactical RPG combat, which is fun, difficult, and satisfying. However, you can also use (for instance) your Growth spell out of combat to make a tree grow, then cut it down with an axe, take the lumber, use a pair of scissors on a cloak to turn it into a bandage, and combine the bandage with the lumber to make a splint.

So i got the opportunity to play test a game developers new game ""raging bullet"" after I did a lets play on one of his previous games, its an awesome thing to see one person creating such unique things.

But it got me thinking, whats the best time to ""Publicly"" release a game, as Obviously it can vary from game to game but I feel like publicly releasing somthing even when its in alpha so long as theirs a disclaimer saying its not finished, is a great way to get willing testers to help finish a game.
I dunno, whats your opinnion?",New Indie FPS Game - How early is too early?
IndieGaming,"First, ""pardon my English"", since it's not my mother language.

Secondly, I'm happy to share that my friend and I finished our first ""public"" game name Piques. It's a simple arcadey game where you have to hit the gem with a ball to earn points. Very good for passing time.

There is no ads, no social element nor IAP. You buy it and you play it. There is only a Highscore, that is local and for you only.
Also there is no crazy item unlocking system to keep you playing for the rest of your life. It's a solo, fun, soothing and minimalist game.

So if you're willing to try it out, [click here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MementoGames.Piques)

The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts.

So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

IndieGaming,"I recently discovered this wonderful game on Steam's early access that holds much promise. The name is [Battle Brothers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/365360/). I wrote a small review on it, and I enjoy writing so I thought I'd share. I don't know how early the demo is on the dev's website, but you *can* [give it a whirl](http://battlebrothersgame.com/downloads/) and see what you think about it

**EDIT:** I should also mention that since a lot of people aren't very trusting of early access, at the very least keep the game in mind once it is released. There is a lot of promise here!

**The review:**
___________________________________________________________________________
When you combine the tactical combat and chance-on-hit mechanics of XCOM, world view and company managment on Mount and Blade: Warband, and random events of FTL, you get Battle Brothers. 

Battle Brothers is a diamond in the rough. It's a game that has combined systems of others and has managed to create a fresh new gaming experience. 

You are the leader of a mercenary company. Your job is to simply do what mercenaries do best: take on dangerous jobs for sweet, sweet money. You'll face goblins, bandits, undead, and orcs. There are perils aplenty, and to combat such things, you have to create a team that can be versatile in all combat situations. This is where the game shines, in the freedom of creating a strategic team that can survive any situation.

You can buy gear, hire more mercenaries with unique traits, and devise tactics to overcome your foes. In combat, it all pays off. But beware, for the game is brutal and unforgiving. Such is the life of a mercenary, to live and die for glory and gold. 

The music is beautiful and crafted wonderfully, and the art-style of the game is charming and very fitting. What I love a LOT about the game are the small little descriptions of mercenaries you hire. They all have little backstories which helps me live inside this randomly generated fantasy world. I love it because I can create my own stories in the absense of a campaign. The writing is also simply superb and well-written.

Though it is early access, it is worth your time. I am looking forward to all of the updates that will be rolling out throughout 2016 and beyond. As it stands, Battle Brothers is worthy of praise.

___________________________________________________________________________",An Early Access Gem - Battle Brothers
IndieGaming,"Whether it's on FB, twitter or email newsletter, what is it that convinces you to say ""alright, I'll do it?"" Is it ENTIRELY based on interesting idea/theme/premise? Or perhaps the right art style and screenshots? Maybe it's the frequency, seeing a game pop up in your feed a lot? Do videos and GIFs attract you more than static imagery? Or maybe it's only via promos like getting a key for a previous game for a sign up?

For me, I rarely follow indie games. But when I do, it's not only for the genre/style/premise I like. A big factor is if I feel the project is actually moving forward and has a chance of success (i.e. frequent updates with steady improvements) and if the devs communicate a lot, particularly insightful behind-the-scenes devblogs. In fact I probably follow more design and code blogs for games rather than the games themselves if that makes sense.

I also prefer more small, indie and friendly writing style, never follow big triple-A studios. And I'm never sold on a game just because of a cool art style or direction.

IndieGaming,"So after reading the 10% rule I fear that my game's promotion maybe be on the line. As an indie developer, it is incredibly hard to reach out to the community and bring attention to my game. I rely on an social media output so other people can see and hopefully share or atleast like/+1/upvote. 

Building the game is stressful enough but trying to get the news about the game out there is something that cant just be about when its mostly the how. I know i can finish my game but how do i know people will see it?

I admire developers like the Elysian Shadows team or the Son of Nor team. They got a lot of attention from YouTube and then started a Kickstarter. Youtube might be the answer for some people but what about people who cant record a nice video or people who dont have anything in their game worth showing due to graphical limitations and cant show anything until near completion. Should you wait after finishing a game and spend a lot of time promoting before release?

The game is a solo, turn-based game where you have to complete certain objectives within certain turn limits. Each turn you get dice representing your workers. They're rolled and you play them, move them, and activate them around the board, trying to get building materials, food, and more dice. 

My first reaction to the game was ""I feel like I'm playing a solo Roll for the Galaxy"". It's not as polished or as deep yet, but seeing as it's an early prototype, it was totally understandable. The mechanic of rolling your ""workers"" and then figuring out what's the best way to use what you've got is a phenomenal way to generate hard decisions. 

My second thought was where the game could go from the early prototype. There's a ton of room for the game to get more complex without the learning curve increasing too much. There's a deck of cards that you have access to throughout the game which can enhance some of your workers on the board or help them move. Varying the cards and workers (i.e. qualitatively different types of dice) will take the game to a different level.

The only constructive feedback I could give is already stuff that is supposed to get implemented into the game such as slightly more complexity/variation and some learning missions/tutorials.

Overall, I thought the game was an excellent, light, single player game. When I say light, I mean in terms of length and commitment required. It had strategy, hard decisions, interesting mechanics, and the ability to tackle the same problem in multiple different ways, injected into a minimalistic package.

IndieGaming,"So found this project on /r/Games yesterday, the Kickstarter just started a few days ago and they have a 2 hour demo available. My expectations weren't high but I found that I really enjoyed the game. It cuts out a lot of the old school ""fat"" of retro style RPGs and focuses on quick ability-laden battles and (hopefully?) engaging dungeon puzzles. There's no random encounters, and zero grinding. The script is well written, and the dungeon segments are fairly short with a good pacing inbetween side quests (diversions).

IndieGaming,"I am a relatively newer gaming Youtuber and as I go, I learn more and more guidelines you can follow to have an easier time to success if you're not absolutely terrible* but following all of these rules can really start to impact the quality of your content.

*These rules can include but are not necessarily limited too: Optimize SEO (Name, tags, desc, thumbnail), play newer stuff, if you're smaller focus on indiedev, humorous or informative videos are more worthwhile than others, sometimes getting mediocre videos up quickly is better than getting, race to be on the first page etc etc

What I'm wondering (for comparative use in a video about the trials and tribulations of being a ""Content Creator"") is there a similar set of guidelines in the IndieDev scene? One thing I've heard a lot about is the race to the bottom, which I get the gist of and I'm sure there are a number of people in both Youtube Gaming and IndieDev that have quite a bit to say of ""Youtuber Bait""

Hey everyone,
I'm Aleks from La Cosa Entertainment. I do mostly marketing, and right now we're promoting Klaus. Klaus is our first game, and it's a 2D puzzle platformer but I like to call it a ""existential platformer"". Initially we wanted to make a hardcore platformer with a meaningful narrative. As we increased the game in scope, and increased the number of mechanics (including some that aren't so puzzle platformy) we shifted our attention to the meaningful narrative side. Of course this doesn't mean Klaus isn't challenging, it just means it's not Super Meat Boy challenging. More importantly it means that we used gameplay to tell the story rather then keep them apart. I'd gladly get into other aspects if there's interest!
The game revolves primarily around Klaus, an amnesiac trying to find the truth and get out of his mechanical prison. He meets K1, a friendly brute, who helps him along the journey. We love meta and fourth wall breaking stuff, so you can find it in every pore of Klaus. For example, you as the player are also a character and Klaus often recognizes this. He communicates with you through text embedded in the background, and in a level or two even reacts physically. I'd gladly get into other aspects if there's interest!
The game is out on the PS4, and it's $20. You get around 8 hours of playtime, which includes two endings. There's also an arcade mode, designed for all of you speedrunning fans!

IndieGaming,"[Dark Passage](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/daigonite/play-blind-dark-passage-and-the-reless-audio-engin) is a game idea where you play as a person who recently went blind in an aviation accident. In the accident, the plane crashes in the wilderness, and there are a variety of locations where you will need to survive. You navigate purely through audio and using your hand to touch things.

The game simulates putting your hand out. Your hand, as it touches objects, covers a certain percentage of that object. Once it hits over a certain base percentage, you identify the object and can use it. Each object has a wide variety of properties that restrict it's specific use. For example, sticks can be used for navigation, building shelter, building smoke signals, weapons, or components for other tools, based on their shape, weight and other properties. You can also use other tools to act as your hand, to extend your distance.

You either have to find civilization, manage to have someone find you through a smoke signal or something similar, or a third condition that involves figuring out the puzzle surrounding the monster of the particular area you're in. That same monster will haunt you in your dreams, which are still visual, and will eventually try to kill you through these dreams, so you have to make haste.

In addition I'm trying to double up this by making the audio engine behind the game marketable as well, so others can use it. The engine is specially designed to be able to detect collisions and support muffled sounds through walls, among other things.

A little about myself: I am an amateur developer for audio games for the blind. For the last 2.5 years I've been building out a [pokemon port for the blind](http://braillemon.tumblr.com/) in my spare time. This project is the result of me being frustrated with the limitations of current 3D audio positioning systems, which became pretty apparent while working on this game.

Many times a game like this is told to be ""impossible"", but through carefully designing a custom audio engine (one that I wish to market after this game is released), 3D audio positioning is possible. 

Edit: I've updated the video, it's now a narrated demonstration of the prototype I built of the system. You can hear that the reverb changes as I approach the surface. However, there are some problems with the prototype that hopefully I'll flesh out in the future.",[SP - Game] Dark Passage - Play as a person who goes blind in an accident and survive in the wilderness
IndieGaming,"Hi,


I'm an IndieDev and currently working in my first commercial game. So far 4 publishers have already contacted us and I haven't thought much about having a formal publisher working with us. I would like to here from you what you think about it. Is it worth? Do you know how much % they take? Also how to chose, what do I have to consider when choosing a publisher?


Cheers,

@ES_Rateke",Regarding publishers
IndieGaming,"Hi,

My name is Luciano Rateke and I’m a dev at Expression Studios, a small studio formed by 7 people working on our spare time. We’ve been working on Clown’s Secret for almost 2 years from now and from the beginning had the idea of writing regularly on a dev blog. Unfortunately it had to be stopped as we had to prioritize our time in developing the game and passed through a very busy year. But now we are back to our dev blog, and proudly want to share it with you!


[Clown's Secret First Showing](https://youtu.be/h6aFNTu8o_0)




**WHAT IS CLOWN’S SECRET?**

 Clown’s (as in short we call it) is an adventure game influenced by comedy movies of the silent age. The player will control Hal and Halbert, two detectives that are chasing a mysterious Clown through Tomainia, while in the process meeting with some non peculiar characters in scenarios that feel at home in the 20’s films.
 Clown’s is a point-and-click game that makes use of traditional mechanics and user interface of the genre. It’s full of puzzles, most of them being Inventory and Lateral Thinking puzzles.*And most of all, this is a fun game! We want to see players to laugh and smile while playing it!*


 From now on we’ll post regularly on our dev blog. We want to talk with people about Clown’s, game development, indie games and game ideas in general. Let’s keep in touch through twitter ([@ExprStudios](https://twitter.com/ExprStudios)) or our [Dev Blog](http://exprstudios.tumblr.com).


 And to commemorate we made a video showing for the first time Clown’s Secret.
 Hope you like it :)

Hi!

My name is Lewis, and for the past 5 years, it's been a long-time dream of mine to have my own YouTube channel. 

**I am a passionate believer that video games are our generation's storytelling, bringing us closer to emotional connections with the medium through interaction, and that YouTube is the future of entertainment as we know it.**

Since November last year, I've been able to make that dream a reality, and started my channel - [Oddly Specific](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCegFVKmqzPwnmOZpJHeNaag) - where I play Survival Games, Rogue-Likes, and Indie games with innovative mechanics and/or (preferably ""and!) cool art styles that interest me. Since this has been my dream for almost as long as I can remember YouTube even existing, I take immense personal pride in the professionalism and level of content that I present to my audience, and I want to give my channel the best possible chance to grow and flourish. It's hard sometimes to judge the right kind of community to introduce myself to, but from what I can tell, so long as I behave by the subreddit rules, you're happy to have me. I don't intend to spam my videos, but Indie games makes up a theoretical third of my content (and always will), so I thought I would share and see if I can find some like-minded people that enjoy my content.  


Here are some of the indie games I've spotlighted - there's also things like Don't Starve and Dungeon Of The Endless on my channel. Soon I will be adding Crashlands to the other 2/3rds of my channel content. Maybe you'll see something you've not come across before; maybe you'll enjoy watching the game in general. I'm going to be uploading a channel update in the next few days asking which of these 4 people would like to see more of on a longer letsplay series on my channel:

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  
  * Links to the project -   
  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.  


As always [subreddit rules apply](/r/indiegaming/rules). And remember: top level comments *must* include self promotion. Have fun everyone!

IndieGaming,"Hi guys.

If you’ve ever woken up in the middle of the night and asked yourself what would happen if you mixed a poor Norwegian artist with a German programmer, the answer is simple: a game about a pig that tries online dating.

The game is in a way like Flappy Bird or Snake combined with a wild and funny story that is based on true events. I made a short video (50 seconds) that explains most of it, and you can see the video and also download the game here (it`s free):

[www.dig-pig.com](http://www.dig-pig.com/) 

I would really like to know what you think! Are we totally lost with a pig in the dark forest of love? Or do you like it? People have been really positive about the story, but we have received reports that the gameplay is challenging, and you might end up breaking your phone playing it.

We actually have video of one of our testers going bananas and losing it when he`s playing. If you want to see it:

If you want to know more, simply play the game, because everything is explained in the story :)

IndieGaming,"Hi guys!

A few friends and i have started a mini games project to see if we can stomach eachother to finish it. Surprisingly, we've gotten pretty far on the project and it's gotten to the stage where we are thinking of releasing to the public to play.

A few questions that i would love your feedback on:

1. If we put ads on the game, will we need to declare tax?
2. How difficult/troublesome is it to add the game onto app/play store?
3. Will Apple/Android take a cut off any revenue earned?

We'll appreciate any further guidance or tips that we might've overlooked!

Thanks again!",Releasing on Android/iOS
IndieGaming,"Hi all,

I've been working on a new game, Defragmented, for the past two years. Maybe you've heard of my past two projects, Thief Town or Noir Syndrome? I had done marketing and business for these past two games but never actually got involved with development until Defragmented.

There are a lot of great cyberpunk stories out there, and it's easy to rip them off or make something derivative that plays to tropes. I worked really hard to make sure that my story, a tale of genetically modified musuem curators and neo-Egyptian cults, still fit within the genre while exploring new ground (I mean, come on - we have a level shaped like a neon Anubis mask. Come on!!). Plus, it was a real challenge fitting a story around top-down shooter gameplay, as someone who loves visual novels and the freedom of storytelling provided there.

If you'd like to check the game out, it's on Steam right now (currently with 10% discount). It's got a killer soundtrack featuring Mitch Murder from KUNG FURY and Power Glove from Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I did all the business and helped rope in these artists plus an sfx designer and 2D artist for cutscene work. For two guys just out of college, I'm pretty proud of our hard work.

http://store.steampowered.com/app/426170/

I want to give back, too - so if you guys have any questions about what development was like (we had a failed Kickstarter campaign that we persevered through, etc.), ask away!

Please check out the game, pick it up if it sounds interesting to you, and support young indies. Thanks for your time.","[SP - Game] I spent the last two years with one other person making a cyberpunk action-RPG. He developed, I wrote. It's called Defragmented."

The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor.

So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

","Self Promotion Megapost, 15 February 2016"
IndieGaming,"Hello everyone!

Here I just want to discuss a few ways devs can create income making games. I don't think its as black and white as people think. How have you earned income for making games in the past? What would you recommend and what would you avoid? 

Ideally, we make our dream games and sell them for a profit...but is this realistic for everyone? Please share different ideas and approaches that have allowed you to continue doing what you love: making games. These range from utilizing publishers, licensing game code, selling game assets, crowd sourcing, investors, Patreon, merch, etc 

I will start with one approach I enjoy: Freelance Game Development

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although I have been making games for 10 years, I have little to no fan base. As a result, when I decided to develop games full time, it was a huge risk for me to develop a game of my own. As a recent student and solo dev, I really can't afford the risk involved...i'm already in debt. 

As a result, I turned to Freelance work. 

So far, I have loved freelance work. If you are a solo dev, you are invaluable to a client. You can do everything they need; or better yet, hire others and direct them properly. If you have an eye for what works and what doesn't, you are golden. 

Advantages:

* You are payed throughout all of development. If the game does well or not, at least you are paid.
* You don't have to worry about business, marketing, etc! You just get to focus on making games, woohoo!
* You will learn a lot in the process and improve (all while getting paid)
* If you budget properly, you can actually take your time to make a QUALITY game you are proud of rather than shotgun out some crap
* You can negotiate royalties if you still want additional income from the project
* You often retain creative control...and get paid for it. Most companies who want games have a VERY vague theme or idea for their game and will actually encourage (and pay you) to come up with ideas and use your creativity to create an awesome game. For example, for my last project my partner's initial instructions were simple: A game with a monster truck in it. 
* You get a teammate! A good client is like a team member. They help with ideas, development, motivation etc. Additionally, they provide a source of accountability to help you get things done on time. 
* You can employ other devs and friends to help on your contracts!


Disadvantages:

* You will not own the IP to your game. 
* Depending on your contract, you will not see revenues from the game if it takes off and generates a lot of money. 
* You will not be expanding your own brand in most cases.
* You will not have as much control as you will have someone who can veto things you do.
* It takes some time and practice to learn how to land jobs, detect good clients, and deal with the properly. I have never once asked for an upfront payment and never once had problems with pay. I have heard nightmare stories before....just deliver on your promises and make sure you have a flexible client.




Ultimately, if you are a budding developer, client work is a great way to expand your skillset and prepare you for self publishing...all while earning income!",Different Ways to Earn Money Making Games

",Am I allowed to advertise my new game even if it costs?
IndieGaming,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I've recently had a speed-dating style event where I pitched my indie game to multiple investors and other business professionals. Several asked a questions separating the business side of things from the art side of things. 

It got be thinking how most indie developers think of themselves. I'd like to think of it as making a good artistic product will correlate to good business. On the other hand if you think of yourself as a business first, it might allow you to bring in more funding to ultimately be able to develop a more finished product.

I know that the ""business"" and the ""art"" are not mutually exclusive, but I'd love to hear how you guys think of yourselves on this topic.

IndieGaming,"Hey everyone! I hope you are ready for my super exciting first self promotion!

I have always been making unfinished, little prototypes. But finally I thought 'Screw' it, I am gonna post some shit. Currently I am in school for programming, so I don't have a lot of time to create more unfinished projects.. So bare with me if you decide to follow my progress on my [tumblr](http://rondonron.tumblr.com/)

This a mobile prototype that consists of a white square that must jump off of, and over moving obstacles. While avoiding the pesky red squares.. And that is it haha. [Here is some High Quality footage](http://rondonron.tumblr.com/post/139270700899/hey-check-out-this-potato-gif-of-this-prototype) sorry about the potato quality.. pretty tired/lazy atm to spruce it up.

And to add I used uHeartBeast's [Movement Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E59MUTFYhrc) to help build a base on the movement, and get the right smooth feel. He is so much help!

Anyways, I am planning to add actual art and an in game store to add hats to the white square, the money will be earned by the total distance traveled when your run is over! I also plan to add some multiplayer fun in the future!


So what do you guys think? Obviously this is a prototype, but anything I should add or tweak to it? Or something you would want to see?

Constructive criticism is welcomed !

I plan to finish this soon..ish.. When ever I have free time during school I will throw some hours on this thing. I have many ideas for the future games that I cannot wait to share when the time comes.. And they have been on the backburner for a few years. So come on and travel on this adventure!

IndieGaming,"I'm a developer working for Far Road games, a small team spread between the UK and US. We're older gamers interested in morally-murky stories and the weirder/darker side of humanity. We love post-apocalyptic fiction of all kinds, and being big fans of the city building genre, we wanted to create a game focused on people, society and ethics. 

We've been working really hard on our first game, Atomic Society, over the last year and we're really excited to share our progress with everyone. We recently published the project to Kickstarter and Greenlight and were hoping for your support! Scott (our designer) has been making regular posts on our subreddit, where you can follow along with development and see how we have progressed!

----------
ATOMIC SOCIETY

Atomic Society is a city-building game where you can set all the laws and morals for a post-apocalyptic settlement. As you build structures and tend to people's needs, strange behaviours and crimes will unfold among the population. You will soon be forced to set laws and tackle difficult moral dilemmas. 

Deal with humanity in its rawest state. Create a settlement that reflects your values or that represents your political fears.

Every man and woman who comes to your city will have interesting psychological and behavioural traits based on real (and sometimes controversial) issues that few games have ever portrayed.

- Over 40 personality types will interact with each other. 
- One citizen might hate immigrants but one might welcome them in with open arms. 
- One citizen could be a racist. Another a paedophile. Someone else might be in favour of the death penalty, or legalising drug-use.
- One person might have a fondness for eating human flesh. Another might want to ban the city from eating meat entirely. 

For every dilemma, there are 4 solutions leading to over 100 different moral solutions, letting you build a society just the way you want it. Every law you enact in Atomic Society causes a ripple effect. Your choices will visibly affect how your people live and what gameplay challenges you will face.  

What will you do with murderers, for example? It won’t take long until one citizen in your town kills another. Perhaps they killed a child or your best worker. How will you handle this?

- Execute someone and you’re down one worker and your violent solution might encourage more attacks. 
- Lock a prisoner up for life, and you’ll have to find jail space for them. The convict might even escape. 
- Re-educate the offender and he might be bluffing and go on to reoffend.
- Exile him and he might return with angry friends...

IndieGaming,"My name is Marc, I was the Founder and CEO of a small mobile studio based out of NY. We had done some contracted work along with building our own games and releasing through a publishing partner.

Now, I primarily consult for other companies in the mobile game space and haven't had the time to clean them up and re-launch.

So here they are for free! no micro transactions, no ads, no catch. Feel free to share with friends if you like them and perhaps one day I will relaunch them for iOS and Android myself.

**Guns N' Boxes** is a 4-player top-down multiplayer shooter reminiscent of Bomberman where your weapons get randomly switched. It's got tons of references to other media, and we tried to make the characters strange but unique and charismatic. The Goal is to get it Greenlit, release an Early Access and then add content until the game meets our standards of what a good multiplayer should be.

There's local and online multiplayer, and planned seamless integration, so ideally, you play with your friends online and on your couch at the same time.

The goal was also to keep the weapons varied and make the gameplay a mix of strategically finding cover and jumping guns-blazing at the other's players' faces.

Anything you would improve? Have done differently? 'Negative' feedback is way better than a ""Yay, I love it"" from friends or family and the team would like a bunch of experienced developers to give us their thoughts.

For a couple of months I've been working part-time on a personal game project. The last game I worked on was the hl mod Brainbread more than 10 years ago, and it turned out that with modern game engines many things have become a lot easier. I've made enough progress with the game that now I'd like to figure out how to proceed: should I keep working on it as a personal project or should I invest more resources, get additonal help, and try to get it approved on Steam greenlight? For that I would like to probe the interest of the indie gaming community and hear people's thoughts on the concept. Since it's still relatively early in development, I'd also be happy to hear suggestions and ideas :-)

* Child of Light
* Life is Strange
* Portal (though she never did the final battle, because puzzles with a time limit are frustrating for her)
* Borderlands and Skyrim (but just the exploring and the fighting, not any of the logistical equipment management or even buying upgrades. I had to do that for her.)

IndieGaming,"**Spoilers for Deadbolt below**

It seems a sequel featuring Ibzan as a playable character may be a possibility eventually.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/394970/discussions/0/412449508275848149/

In response to my suggestion of Ibzan being playable in custom levels:

&gt;...playing as Ibzan should be more than a tacked-on editor option for his importance! (in my opinion!)

Might be a stretch but seems to imply some upcoming expansion on Ibzan. Though Hopoo does go on to say:

&gt;n-no im still focusing on the game, there's nothing secret in the works.

Which either suggests that nothing is planned at the 
moment *or* dlc/patches will be coming to the game.

Hopoo expresses an interest in Ibzan as a playable character:

&gt;that'd be a neat idea. what would ibzan do to make it significantly different than the standard reaper?

http://steamcommunity.com/app/394970/discussions/0/392184289303223080/

Seems Hopoo might be toying with the idea of some sort of expansion featuring another playble character on top of new stuff for the level editor. If so I'm quite excited as Deadbolt was a game I was both eagerly anticipating since the demo last year and also is definitely one of my favourite indie games of 2016 so far.

* Please the audience so they throw stuff to you;

* Unlock new content and find out the secrets of the Satellite;

* Defeat awesome Champion monsters;

* Dedicate your victories to one of the three big Sponsors to get Upgrades;

Hi IG, my name's Chris, and I'm helping make Mable &amp; The Wood, a 2D action/adventure game. The main developer, whose project this really is, is Andrew Stewart, of the UK. He and I, and with the talented musical help from Fat Bard Music, are making this pretty cool game.

I've only been a part of the team for just over a month or so, as I've been brought on for my specific artistic skills (pixel lettering/font making), but Andrew has been laboring over this project for a year now. Mable &amp; The Wood (Mable) started off as a little Ludum Dare game, but with positive reception, and a desire to build upon it, Andrew set off to make the tiny game into something bigger - into what is has become so far, with hope from a successful Kickstarter to create a fully-fledged gaming experience :D

The premise of Mable is you playing the part of a shape-shifting girl, able to transform yourself into beasts (the bosses) of the game as you slay them. Along with your shape-shifting ability, you drag along a large sword- too big to properly wield. But as you transform, you both are able to move about the levels, however you drop the sword in its place; and when transforming back to your human form, you link the sword back into your hands, cutting anything in between the two. Killing monsters then refills your magic, which is needed to re-transform.

""Combat is movement"" is the leading mechanic of this game, to summarize.

Aside from the standard 2D movement/level designs, the game's graphics are a colorful pixel art style, with nice animations (and everything will only get better when the real game is made after the Kickstarter :D), supported by my help as text creator, and topped off with the wonderful sound-making from Fat Bard.

If you fancy even just a peek, head over to the Kickstarter, and if you're feeling extra nice, help get us Greenlit on Steam.

IndieGaming,"Hey everyone, so I just wanted to give a little attention to a gem of a game that I have played on and off for about a decade now.

Skylords is a 'SkyLords is a real-time, browser based, online, multiplayer strategy game (MMOG), which includes many impressive features such as diplomacy, trading, piracy, espionage, space battles, custom spaceship model designing, round bonuses and clan warfare. Despite all these features, this game is very easy to start because of the short training mission all new players have to pass'.

The game was started up back in the early 2000's and there were thousands of players and hundreds of clans/guilds actively competing for the top spots in the game. Some of the most powerful clans had very active training clans where newer members could join and establish themselves in the game and eventually 'graduate' into the 'veteran' clan.

The community is one of the most closely knit i'd ever been a part of, most people knew each other at a personal level and clan affiliations were life-blood. If you got caught doing something unethical, no one would touch you and you were constantly hunted.

Unfortunately late in 2000, the original creator of the game known as 'Zygimantas' decided that he would no longer be supporting the game, and a player of the game known as 'Professor' decided to purchase it. During this transfer the game went down for a period of over a month, in which most players assumed that the game was closed and we lost almost 90% of our community and even to this day have not recovered.

There are currently 20-30 active individuals that have been playing the game for over a decade. The game is still finanically supported by 'Professor' (though he no longer plays) and has agreed to keep it open indefinitely while his son 'Ili"" provides all the technical support and takes suggestions on upgrades and new implementations from the entire community. In fact many if not all of the members have access to his e-mail, skype and phone number should anything need to be quickly communicated.

I'd like to bring his MMO strategy game to light, it was one of my favorite games. It caters to those that are more casual and can only spend 30 minutes to a hour a day, and even those of us whom prefer to be on 24/7.
The friendships I have made in this game have been lifelong, going as far as to personally meet some of these people in real life.

I highly encourage you to give this game a shot despite it's small community. If we can get just a couple of you guys interested, I can guarantee that any player that is currently established in the game will gladly help a new player out to grow and expand.

We largely cater to older players (20+) so please keep that in mind as you play your way through the universe. If you ever have any questions we have a New Players forum where questions can be asked and answered promptly. Otherwise you can ask here and i will reply as soon as possible.

The game can be found at www.skylords.com ... it has several forums for different languages though the primary language is english, we offer and can accommodate to all if not most languages.

I hope to see some of you out there! Share you experience if you try the game here!

EDIT: The amount of new players that the game has seen has almost doubled our current game population! That's insane! If even a handful of you guys stick with us and join the family then that's already awesome! Thanks for giving it a try everyone &lt;3. And once again, please introduce yourself on our forum!

Swordy’s weapons and damage model are completely physics based, you’ll need to master the momentum and weight of your character and weapon together to fight effectively. It’s easy to pick up but leaves a lot of space for mastery. 

Swordy has been built with a local-multiplayer focus from the beginning. We ourselves love hanging out with friends to share a game and laugh together as often as possible. In this time of instant digital communication its a great excuse to catch up in person and have fun together. We wish there were more local-multiplayer games these days, but also do sympathize with those less able to see friends in person!

We have been working on Swordy for over two years now, half of that was all spare time after work.

Its a huge milestone and exciting to finally be on Greenlight! Please help us make it happen &lt;3

Hey guys, my name is Roma. Im developing an indie horror game, called Darkness Anomaly. Im from Germany and working on this Project over a year and half now =). 

The reason i am posting this on reddit, is to show you the new gameplay trailer i published an hour ago! I am really proud of it and was hoping to get some contructive feedback on it. But first let me tell you something about the game! 

It's an open world horror game, based in a small town in the states. A detective was send out from Cleveland to this city to investigate a crime happened in that town. It, seems like it was just a ritual murder from crazy people in the town, like summoning of something they believe would come alive. Maybe some kids? But during the investigation, the Detective namen **Nick Revees** will come across some strange things happening around him. On his way to solve this case, things get worse and Nick is feeling like he's slowly loosing his mind, untill a demon appears. The Demon Vassago (which is played be the great voice of Liquid Snake, sorry i know but i just love to brag about this amazing voice actor :3!) Vassago seeks out to Nick, asking for help to get his might back. The ritual morder was a summoning of him and a try which succeded to steal Vassago's might. It turns out, a sect has build its strenght over the years. And the real story begins when, Nick, Vassago and the Sect Leader Licht collide in a battle. 

_____________________________________________________

I am really proud of the characters i've created with Darkness Anomaly. 
And i hope this will be one of the strenghts of the game. Character which are not only bad &amp; evil. I want to make the player understand the actions and thoughts of the characters and feel for them. Its also very dramatic and tells a good story with the most powerfull engine out there, the cryengine. Im also proud of what i've created with the level of detail and realism. 

But where's the gameplay? What is the gameplay? 

Well during the story, you will have to solve cases. 
The strength of Vassago's stolen might is not complete. Licht needs to obtain more power by sacrificing people. But, there is a reason why he choose the people he sacrifice. You need to find out which reason it is to come close to the sect. In the demo which is coming in a few weeks. You will be able to play the game for 2 hours and solve a crime happened there. A woman, dead in a valley in the streets of the town. Who is she? 
As she died, the might of Licht, began to manifistate her soul, is the pure 
reincarnation of the sin, this woman committed in her live. To prevent the soul to rise as the full manifistation of her sin, you need to find out who she was, with help from Vassago. But you won't be able to stop it completly. Depends on your decisions, the sin will grow power, or lose it. So its on you, to fight it in the end. Yep, you are a detective.. you have a gun and you will have to use it! 

I also want to hear your opinions on my event system in the game. Its actually pretty simple, in the upcoming demo, you will be able to explore some parts of the world. Either you can run around, do your task's fast and complete the demo. But you will not see much. I prepared the level, the further you explore, the more events it will cause (horror). So one event causes another one. I've got always about 3-4 chains of events. But that requires you to exlore the world. So if you not much of a exlorer the game could be not as good as if you exlore stuff. It wouldnt cause some of the events. What do you think? Should i force the player to cause them? Or let it to the exlorers make the demo more enjoyable?

So i hope you liked it guys! Give me your thoughts on it! 
I will just leave my social links right here, i would be happy if you could follow me and keep up with the newest stuff from the game:

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  
  * Links to the project -   
  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.  


As always [subreddit rules apply](/r/indiegaming/rules). And remember: top level comments *must* include self promotion. Have fun everyone!

IndieGaming,"Some of you here may have heard of [TagPro.](http://tagpro.gg) If you haven't, it's a free, browser-based, multiplayer Capture-the-Flag game. It's a simple game at its core -- the game relies on each player's momentum (we're all balls, because why not :D), allowing flag carriers to juke the other team on their way to bring back the flag, bringing emergent complexity in tactical positioning and teamwork.

Despite being a silly little webgame which was only meant to be a side project for the developer to experiment with node.js, TagPro has gathered a sizeable community and extensive, mature competitive scene.

The oldest and most prestigious league, Major League TagPro, has its 9th championship game, Super Ball IX, today at 9:30 PM Eastern, and it will be streamed on Twitch at [MLTP Live](http://www.twitch.tv/mltplive) with pre-game coverage starting at 8:45.

***

**Why should you care?**  

Most people reading this probably haven't played TagPro, or only played it briefly after seeing it posted somewhere on Reddit. There are two answers.

Firstly, it's just plain going to be fun. Lots of fun, community-created content, not to mention that the gameplay itself should be excellent. Last season's Super Ball averaged around 800 views, and we're expecting similar numbers tonight.

**More seriously, though, TagPro has one of, if not the most extensive money-free, decentralized, entirely community driven, self-sustaining eSports scenes around.**

For example, take Major League TagPro. The league featured over 200 players across 32 teams this season, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The second and third tiers of competitive TagPro, National League &amp; Amateur League, both also featured over 200 players each, not to mention the European and Oceanic leagues. In total, the global competitive scene for this game spans five leagues, 120 teams, and nearly 1,000 players worldwide!

If that isn't enough, there are no less than three different nightly tournaments in the Americas alone, as well as casual ladder-style leagues, minigame leagues, and a plethora of one-off events. For instance, a recent charity tournament raised over $700 in donations for Doctors Without Borders.

Adding to this is a remarkable community of content creators. Our stream tonight will entirely consist of original community-made content. We have loads of [hype videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1iOXZV7-OE&amp;list=PLe5F72t_2iQ9gn5WtWWbBkTTyfTdlW14A), [fan art,](http://i.imgur.com/SGQ5pLk.png) and [music,](https://soundcloud.com/ronspawnson/su-su-su-su-superball) all community made, which will be featured on a community-hosted stream featuring gameplay on community-made maps...  you get the point.

***

If anything, even if you aren't sure about TagPro (which you should be, it's a blast and is a great example of how simple mechanics can lead to tactically rich gameplay), take a look at what a motivated community can do without need for money, sponsorships, or anything other than the love of a game and competition!",[Community Event] Super Ball IX — A Grassroots eSports Event
IndieGaming,"Hey everyone!

So this past year I thought I'd teach myself how to code. I decided on Java and got to work. Was a hard journey but gradually things made sense. Fast forward and with some help from LibGDX I began work on a game.

I'd like to present ""Mildred"", an old school top down shooter, 16bit style. It's pretty basic in that you just run around shooting stuff but hopefully some will find it entertaining.

I also made the sound and music using LSDj on a Gameboy for some 8bit goodness.
Graphics are from OpenGameArt by a guy called DENZI.

Runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Google Chrome web browser.

IndieGaming,"Hello guys!

My name is Joel and I'am a German Game Developer.
We are a new team and want to get some feedback.

So our Team PlaytypusGames just created a Prototype of a Top-Down Rogue-Lite Space Shooter,  where the player explores several random generated star-sectors. As a bounty hunter the player tries to kill different enemies and bosses to earn credits, which are necessary to upgrade his ship. With those upgrades and several random drops he will be able to complete his journey through the universe and eliminate all evil troublemakers and ascend in the League of Bounty-Hunters to be the best.
Throughout the game the player will find blueprints of technologies, so he can customize his ship with different attributes and abilities like a stealth generator or a bullet shield, so the players have the possibility to play the game in different playstyles.


So my question here is: Are you interested in such a game? We need this information to prepare for a possible greenlight, early access campaign.

To give you a feeling for the game I will add some picturesand a video of the prototype:

IndieGaming,"I've just polished off the 0.55 update to my game Maia and wanted to show you all the latest [update video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF4tRY-Av88) (The full changelog is [here](https://blog.maiagame.com/maia-update-0-55-pressure-drop/).)

If you've never heard of it before, Maia is a space colony god game with a hard scifi edge. You have a small group of colonists and you need to meet all their survival needs, from air and food, to mental health and entertainment. Everything in the game is simulated accurately with insanely complex detail. I'm inspired a lot by early Bullfrog games and Dwarf Fortress.

I'm planning to get the game into beta in a few months, to finally escape alpha, so we're doing really chunky updates every thirty days at the moment. We've got to the point where the game is pretty stable, and you can usually play for a good few hours before hitting any noticable bugs (Finally got the tracker below 100 gameplay bugs on the last update!).

Anyway let me know what you think of the video, and feel free to ask me anything. :)

Hey everyone! I’m the co-author and editor of [The Mind’s Eclipse](http://www.themindseclipse.com/), a visual novel/adventure game that I’ve been working on with a small team over the past six months.  We’ve just recently put it up on Steam Greenlight, and have been featured in [Kotaku's Steamed webpage](http://steamed.kotaku.com/the-mind-s-eclipse-is-a-visual-novel-in-which-a-mysteri-1771919478)!  Our intent is for the game to be out by the end of this year.

***
 
**The Mind’s Eclipse**
 
The Mind’s Eclipse is a visual novel with adventure elements mixed in.  We wanted to make a game that allowed us to primarily tell a story, but which would also be able to feature a creative 2D art design and some interactive elements to engage the player.  The team enjoy playing games with lots of dialogue and plot, and we think a lot of other people do, too.  Though visual novels are mostly known for romance games, we thought it could be a good genre to utilize in order to tell a sci-fi, neo-noir story with horror elements.
 
The plot follows a man named Jonathan Campbell who finds himself alone in a hospital in a strange, technologically-advanced city called The CORE, with no memory how he got there.  As the game goes on, he is assisted by a sarcastic but mysterious AI sidekick who assists him in uncovering what happened in the CORE.
 
In The Mind’s Eclipse, you explore interactive environments looking for clues and messages to uncover the mystery of the CORE, where are Jonathan Campbell’s loved ones, and what the purpose is of COSy—a powerful being with an obsessive interest in Campbell.

I'm Pablo Coma, a solo game developer from Belgium. I've been working alone for nearly two years on an RPG project called Healer's Quest.



You can download a [playable demo](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j0jc2hlxr2pq08d/AACfGGefS8XF01EPeCJ5tA_Oa?dl=0) to try the game for yourself (available for PC and Linux)



Healer's Quest is a lighthearted RPG in which you play solely as the healer of a ragtag bunch of unfocused, greedy and highly amoral adventurers. The only match to their (very lacking) skills is their lousy temperament. They will rush head-first into desperate combats, fall into the most obvious traps, get cursed, poisoned, paralysed, vampirized, or – even – killed. It is up to you to ensure they will endure the most grievous wounds and survive their ordeals, in spite of their cripling noobishness.

You are their only hope. You are... their healer !



The game is currently [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pablocoma/healers-quest), but the campaign will end in less than 60 hours.

We also have a gameplay demo up on [itch.io](https://abyssal-arts.itch.io/city-of-the-shroud), if you'd like to try it out! (**Remember to equip your party!!**)

The game is being written by Moira Katson, who has hit #1 on the Amazon Fantasy charts as a self-published author 3 times in under 2 years. 

The story in CotS is driven by players' choices - we release an episode, every player makes decisions over the course of that episode, and we use the cumulative choices of every player as material to write the next episode (the final game will be 4 episodes). We ran a 4-episode test back in February, and players’ choices dramatically altered our approach to the story, changing established plot-lines right from the start.

If that sounds interesting, Moira wrote in-depth about her experience in [our first Kickstarter update](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abyssalarts/city-of-the-shroud/posts/1541337).

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  
  * Links to the project -   
  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.

IndieGaming,"Dear Indie Developers family. We were at [Digital Dragons](http://www.digitaldragons.pl) conference in Kraków at 16-17th May with our game, thus we wanted to share our experience with you. Hopefully you will find it helpful. Have a nice read.

# Disclaimer
We are Jet Toast - duo of gamers and game developers. Currently we are working on a mobile farm manager - [Blocky Farm](http://www.blockyfarm.com) - which is in alpha stage of development.
The first thing you must know is that we are developing our game with our savings, so our money is highly limited.
The Digital Dragons ticket for a single dev was for around 100$. Travel and hostel costs was around 100$ per person too. So for our two it was cost of 400$ just to be there. [We were hotfixing our game during the travel!](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13167272_479759558887311_821128319_n.jpg)

# Expectations
We had almost no expectations with Digital Dragons conference. We knew that our game didn't fit exactly to the audience. We knew that there will be many of #pcmasterrace people. BUT we dreamt about meeting people from Apple to show them our game and get a feedback - that was our main mission to accomplish.

# Preparations
##Our Stand
**Business cards**

We printed them last year so I don't count them.

**Leaflets**

[We printed around 250 leaflets for around 125$.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFW2Ty4uAkj/?taken-by=sortris) It is a quite high cost for an indie dev, isn't it?

**Posters**

We also printed 4 big posters (A3 size) and our game logo. The cost was around 5$.

**3D printed models of animals from our game**

It was a hard decision and it was not easy to accomplish but 3 days before the conference [we decided to have our game models 3D printed](http://i.imgur.com/RoPSvuG.jpg). We selected to print: a barn, dog, pig and cow. They were printed by our friend and it costed us around 30$ for all 4 prints.

**Landing page**

We spent over 20 hours to prepare our responsive, beautiful landing page. The main cost was a time.

**Newsletter**

We used popular mailchimp newsletter plugin. It's free under 1000 subscribers. It is a really popular and easy to connect to our page.

**Press Kit**

We prepared really good press kit with press info, press note, screenshots, renders etc. We put it on the Google Drive and made it public. It was also linked on our landing page.

**Essential:**

Things that are essential to have a good stand and work efficiently:

- one powerbank per person - it's priceless in some cases

- big - at least 24'' screen

- personal computer for hotfixes

- cartons for posters

- power strip

- a lot of tape and scissors

[**Final look of our stand**](http://i.imgur.com/e5yx89G.jpg)

#Execution
##What went good
**We met people from Apple!**

Digital Dragons organizers shared with participants a really good pitch &amp; match application but we didn’t use it. We thought that nobody will use it - that was a wrong assumption. But not everything was lost. At 11am first day, trio of Apple representatives visited our stand. We had 10 minutes conversation with them, we’ve got a lot of feedback: what to focus on and what we shouldn’t do. We also got a contact to them.

*Worth mentioning:* The first thing they did was pinching to zoom in/zoom out for one minute! They really checked if our game is 60 fps &amp; smoothly working on iPad.

**Press**

We were really surprised that press and media liked our game. We know that mobile games are not welcomed, but despite to that, now we have great contacts with really big polish mobile games sites. It is important to stay open and smiled.

**Feedback**

We've got a lot of positive and really helpful feedback. Now we can really see what people liked and what they just didn’t see.

**Visibility &amp; luck**

We had 24'' big screen monitor directed straight on the enter to the building so almost every person that entered the hall could easily see us. We had also a lot of luck to get a desk almost on the beginning of the hall so we were really good visible.

**Contacts**

We made a great contacts with publishers, investors, developers, graphic artists and 3d printing companies so that is great! It opens to us a lot of different possibilities.

##What went bad

We are really happy with these two days even if our game is in pre-alpha stage.

##Evaluation - social media

During these two days our stand was visited by around 60 people. We posted on our Facebook fanpage, Twitter and Instagram.

**Facebook:** 1 post got 2 likes and reached only 176 people. 2 new likes on our company profile.

**Twitter:** 1 tweet got 9 retweets and over 31 likes what gave more than 4000 impressions. 0 new followers connected with this game conference.

**Video and photo posted on my private Instagram profile:** over 30 likes and some nice gamedev followers.

**Landing page** noted ONLY 9 unique views during this two days. Only 5 of them were directly from Kraków.

**PressKit** was downloaded 0 times but two persons asked us to send it via email so it was cool that we could do it instantly.

**We distributed only about 50 leaflets.** That means that over 200 leaflets are unnecessary now and we simply could save here around 100$.

**Posters and monitor** - it increased our visibility a lot. Some people came to us when they saw our graphics.

**T-shirts** - It was great that we chose yellow color. We could find each other easily and we stand out in the crowd I guess.

#Summary
Digital Dragons is the best game conference we participated in. What was the best?
There were 3 types of *paid* tickets:

**Dev** - author of other games - gave us really good feedback and we had a lot of nice time.

**Media** - journalists mainly - it is priceless to know them in the real world and meet face to face. Really nice feeling especially when they liked your game.

**Business** - ad networks managers, publishers, investors - we learnt how to pitch our game, we got difficult questions and hopefully we will stay in touch with them.

**So if you have doubts, we answer: yes, it is worth to show your game on a game conference.**

#Bonus
Frequently asked questions from investors and publishers:

1) What diversifies your game from others in that genre?

2) What is your audience?

3) How big is your audience?

4) How long are you developing this game and when do you plan to release it?

5) How many returning players will make your game profitable?

6) What is your plan to get players?

7) How experienced is your team?

8) How do you plan to make money on your game?

9) Do you have multiplayer/social elements?

10) What platforms do you support? What is the oldest smartphone you will support?

11) What is your game about? Just in 2 minutes, I have no time!

IndieGaming,"Hi! I'm currently writing a report for university, which is exploring how indie games have been allowed to thrive in the current video game industry, and how the industry has adapted to a new type of video game being popular. You dont have to be an expert on the video game industry to answer these questions, I'm just looking for general opinions about indie games and how they're received. So if you have some spare time and want to help, I'll post some questions below. Thanks for helping!

Do you feel that The Developer programs for Xbox and Playstation, as well as Steam Early Access, have encouraged more people to get involved with making video games?

Is it easier for small time devs to support themselves and their work with ways of making money before the game has released, such as Patreon or Kickstarter? Do you think these have any negative side effects?

Do you feel that Youtubers and Twitch streamers have played a big part in how Indie games are recieved?

Finally, what do you think has been the biggest sole reason for indie games getting a rise in popularity?",If you have some spare time...

Most indies use crowdfunding like Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, Patreon etc. I think we could use a discussion about the backing tiers. What works well?  What doesn't?  What makes you want to back a project? What turns you away from a project?

IndieGaming,"I'm a sole developer of Nuclear Napalm Entertainment and would like to present you my latest game. 

I was working on it for the last 2 months and since today the game is available on Google Play and depends on the results there is a chance that it will be ported to iOS later.

# Why Epic Split Truck Simulator?

My initial intention was to make a small but catchy game. The game that refers to something that everyone (at least in the internet) knows. The game that offers the same amount of fun and challenge. The game that you really want to show your friends. 

When I was thinking about the theme for the game I checked some viral things that happened in the internet for the last couple years. And when I was watching this [epic adertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7FIvfx5J10) it was a ""BINGO!"" moment for me. The first question that came to my mind was - **why there is still no game about makeing an epic split between 2 trucks!?!?** So, I decided to fill this epic gap make this game!

Unfortunately, I can't use JCVD or Chuck Norris as the main character of the game, so there is a crash test dummie (make sense, no?). This game is not about making a split, this game is about driving skills. If you think closely, it's not a big deal to make a split between trucks if you can make a split on the ground. The real challenge is to drive trucks in a right way to allow JC make an epic split. In this game you take control of the truck on the righ and truck on the left controlled by AI. Your goal is to try to maintain the same speed as the truck on the left and don't stay to far from it to prevent epic ~~fail~~ fall. And don't forget about billboards...

# How you can help

I think most of us know how hard it is to reach the wide audience, especially for small indies. So, I kindly ask you to help me spread the word about this game:

First of all, you can

* [**dowload and play it**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nuclearnapalm.epicsplitsim) if you have Android device
* Give it 5* rating (only if you really think that game deserves 5 stars)
* Tell your friends about this game (I do believe that you won't be ashamed of it, it's not Candy Crush)
* Help me spread the word on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NuclearNapalm)
* and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/epicsplit/)

The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

IndieGaming,"In Metroid, you have a single gun and a single button to fire that gun. When you get a new weapon upgrade, you don't have to do anything; you can just keep pressing B and firing the same gun you've been firing the whole game, but now with an upgrade. (Usually upgrades gave more damage and a new property like enemy-piercing or the ability to go through walls, but I'm not specifically looking for that here.)

In a lot of Metroidvanias, and even in the Metroid-y Castlevania games, you get new weapons rather than upgrades of a single weapon. This really, really changes the feeling of progression in the game. Instead of actually feeling like you've gotten an upgrade to your character, you just got a new weapon that is stronger or slightly different somehow. With the Metroid style of upgrades, your gun naturally upgrades with you, and it feels a lot better.

So,  are there any games that actually follow the Metroid style, as I've described it? To clarify, there are few characteristics of the Metroid style that I'm specifically looking for:

* Only one weapon.
* Your one weapon upgrades over time, rather than you finding new weapons.
* There is no need to switch weapons ever for any situation, except maybe to toggle two upgrades(ala Super Metroid's endgame).
* Situational things, like missiles and super bombs in Metroid, are fine, but they should not be the primary method of attack.",Any Metroidvanias that actually follow the Metroid style of weapon upgrades? (Description inside)

I'm a mentor on a [FIRST robotics](http://www.firstinspires.com/robotics/frc) team. I work primarily with the kids who drive the robot, and scheduling practice times, setting up the field, and getting the robot out to drive is a time-intensive pain. So, I'm looking for a video game that shares some of the same driving characteristics as our bot. It'll keep the students sharp during the summer and off-season, and I might even be able to use it for tryouts and practices.

Since the robots we drive are... quirky, I'm looking for a game with some similar quirks. There are so many indie games out there, that I was hoping you guys could point me in the right direction. Here are the requirements for what I'm looking for, and I'd like to fill as many of these as possible. The ones on top are most important.

1. (Mandatory) Driving game! Tanks and treaded vehicles are preferred (since they skid steer) but cars are alright too.

2. Mario Kart / Twisted Metal style ""Battle Mode""

5. Joystick compatible. I think most games are, but I might as well list this.

4. Annoying camera angles. A stationary non-overhead camera would be ideal.

3. Multiplayer. LAN preferred, but Internet is fine.

6. Vehicles don't coast when you let off the acceleration, they stop almost immediately.

7. Controls are kind of imprecise or twitchy.

8. A variety of vehicles to choose from.

The orbits of the playing field may rotate as you play, depending on how well you control them. Timing is everything to get the largest groups!

The demo contains one game mode, Speed, and two music tracks.

There is a colorblind mode for players, too!

IndieGaming,"I'm currently brainstorming my next move.

**Background:**

I created my first title, Epikos (http://www.epikosrpg.com) myself, based on the games which I liked (Ultima and Final Fantasy).

It's doing ok, not great but not terrible, considering I haven't tried to market it or anything, this is just my hobby and I have a day job.

**What's Next?:**

Rather than just make my next game based on what kinds of things I like, I'm wondering what the reddit indie community wants, hopes for, misses, etc.  

What kinds of games do you think are under-represented?  What do you want to play, but basically, no one has made?  Or not made recently.

Anyway, I thought it would be fun to help me brainstorm based on what you guys want to see.  Always fun to think about games, for me at least.

**Additional Context:**

One piece of context, I'm just one (hard working) man, so suggestions should probably be scoped to what one guy can hope to accomplish.

If it helps give more context, here are my favorite games currently:

*  Ultima (4, 5)

*  Final Fantasy (1, 4, 5, 6)

*  Etrian Odyssey (entire series)

*  Civ 5

*  Dragon Warrior (III, IV)

*  Dwarf Fortress","My first game finished and selling modestly (~410 copies sold). Brainstorming my next move, what would *YOU* guys like to see an indie game dev make?"

During this period some of us fallen in love with each other and even got married. We have created various games with different formats, game play, music etc., and these were not enough for us. We have decided to build a game that drives everyone crazy. It is truly great to know that members of our team are different in preference, but it was hard to construct a plot of a game, which will keep us in shape. Thus, “70 sec” has been created!

- “70 sec” is so addictive that during the testing it made people crush their phones in pulse-pounding excitement, be late for their meetings, and even miss their flights.

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  
  * Links to the project -   
  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.  


As always [subreddit rules apply](/r/indiegaming/rules). And remember: top level comments *must* include self promotion. Have fun everyone!

IndieGaming,"Hello /r/IndieGaming,
I'm Gahtao, one of the developers of a game called Prota Quest (WIP name). Currently we have no game at all though, but we do have a part of the story and some concepts for the gameplay. Before we start really coding it we're still looking to recruit more people. We currently consist of 5 people, all Dutch, but we all speak English so don't worry. 
We need: 
- 2 spriters 
- 1 programmer 
Knowledge of gamemaker might come in handy and if you have any other relevant skills, please tell us. Keep in mind that this project might take a few years and you can't just quit in the middle of it. We also want to meetup atleast once or twice, so keep that in mind if you live outside of Europe. 
This all seems to be a lot, but we do not expect you to work your asses of while we lay back and relax or something. We're looking for equal partners that want to have fun making a game. Everyone in our group so far is still in school, so we also don't expect you to work fulltime on this game, it's more like a side project for fun. :)
If you're interested or have any questions PM me or send me a message on discord: Gahtao#2037
As for the reward... Right now our plan is to split what we earn from the game evenly. Of course there will be exceptions if someone does exceptionally little work.
Thanks for reading, Gahtao

IndieGaming,"Hi, I'm lead Game Designer at Polyraptor Games, a small studio from Uruguay. We've been working on our first game called **Rumpus** for about 7 months and now it's on Steam Greenlight! We are now trying to build some hype for release, and also we want some feedback about our Greenlight page.
Rumpus currently runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and 2 to 4 players can playing using XBOX, PS3, PS4 and generic controllers. One player can also play using the keyboard.

&gt;**What's Rumpus?**

The game is set on a TV show on a distant future, hosted by the ever-charismatic Mr. Rumpus and inspired by the golden age of couch multiplayer. Rumpus is a fast-paced multiplayer action game, chaotic and intense. Players have to pickup and throw items at each other to throw them off the screen. Items can be charged for extra shot speed. Players can also create a shockwave to reflect shots and fight in melee combat, for some added strategy. 

Rumpus is our first commercial game and we've poured our hearts into it.
Recently, we took the game to some local events in Uruguay and kids, teenagers and young adults were quickly competing against eachother and showing passion for the game. I almost cried.
**That's** why we do it.

**WHAT YOU DO**
----

You are the Cosmonaut, the eternal cosmic hero who must shatter the robotic Infinite Legion and rekindle a dying star. Using a one-handed, mouse-driven control scheme, you'll dodge and strike with **1:1 precision and unlimited movement speed**. Evade intense bullet patterns in the blink of an eye, then swipe through entire enemy squads to crush them in a single gesture. Movement is everything in this game, and to the best of our knowledge, **no other shoot 'em up moves like this.**

But it's about more than just speed and precision; it's also about **accessibility**. The modern shoot 'em up genre is generally known for screen-filling ""bullet hell"", lots of ""game over"" screens, and tedious level memorization. But it's 2016 now and we're playing on home computers and consoles, not coin-op arcade machines. We thought it was time for a modernized design that everyone – not just the hardest of the hardcore – could get into.

[Legacy of the Elder Star](http://elderstargame.com/steam) is focused on **playing smart offense**, not picking your way through overwhelming bullet hell. **Enemy patterns change each time you play**, keeping you on your toes and avoiding rote sequence repetition; **online daily challenges** are even further randomized. The main story mode grants unlimited continues; death may limit your scoring potential, but it won't kick you out of the game. And **extensive accessibility options** like a colorblind mode, auto-fire toggle, and adjustable game speed are included for gamers with disabilities, or even just those who want a more casual experience.

----
**WHY WE MADE IT**
----

We kept meeting people who like the *idea* of shmups, but feel like they suck too bad at those games to get any fun out of them. And let's face it: bullet hells in particular are fucking *hard*, by design.

So we made a shmup for those people: something that's fun and easily accessible (you play this game with the mouse and it only requires one hand). That doesn't mean it's trivially easy; in fact, posting a really impressive score is a pretty tall order. What it is, though, is the classic ""easy to learn, difficult to master"", as well as a game that gets out of its own way and just *lets you play*.

It's also really fun to go to shows and see little kids, older people, and disabled gamers really get into the game. Action games have a tendency to alienate those folks, and we don't really think that's fair. Why shouldn't you get to enjoy a satisfying action game just because your reflexes are slowing down, or you were born with a physical disability, or whatever? Everyone deserves to have fun. :)

If you're a suuuuper hardcore shmupper who demands a masochistic challenge, then this honestly might not be the game for you. But if you kinda like the idea of shmups, and have even enjoyed a few, but wish you could just *do better* at them, then you're exactly the type of person we hope will [check out the game](http://elderstargame.com/steam).

I'm Josh Sutphin, founder of [Kickbomb Entertainment](http://kickbomb.us) and creator of [Legacy of the Elder Star](http://elderstargame.com/steam).

The Anime League is preparing for their Summer LAGC and are looking for Indies to come along and show off their work. The event runs on the 2nd and the 3rd and you should be able to set up on the 1st

This sort of event is perfect for hobbyists but also great training ground for those starting out exhibiting. It usually contains 2000+ guests over the weekend so is perfect for those starting out.

They reserve a big chunk of the Gaming area for the Indies so there are plenty of spots for all the sweet games. I am going with a game that mashes Dance Pads and Fighter genre games.

&amp;nbsp;

The event is free to exhibit and they provide a table big enough for two screens plus setup. The monitor/tv hiring is cheap too at £20 a screen for a small and £40 for a large.

For those who want to show off their game and are able to come to London, come and join the Anime Con. It's a great excuse to network with other developers.

Hey guys. I'm one of the artists for this horror game featuring some of our local monsters and legends. We are a small team of less than 10 people from an entertainment software company in the Philippines.

We've been working on this game for a long time, and we're currently in the process of letting people know it exists, and out on steam for $11.99! We also plan to release it on console soon, and we even got a build for VR!

**Okay, what's it about then?**

Nightfall:Escape focuses on our female journalist named Ara Cruz. She's gutsy, and driven. She also decided to explore a haunted mansion in the North because a few reporters had been declared missing.

In this game, you will encounter our local myths and monsters armed with nothing but a flash light, and your puzzle-solving skills.

The reason that we made this game is because the Philippines has rich stories regarding urban legends, and ghosts. We wanted to make our own creative spin in executing what various monsters might look like. As the game develops into completion, we added more and more elements to it, and our marketing has been stalled, so it helps if others could spread the word about this game as well.

IndieGaming,"Hi! I'm an indie dev who recently received an offer from a large gaming site to have my game included in a promotional giveaway [""for exposure""](https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt). They're asking for 20k keys, have quite a large readership, and I believe the whole thing is in good faith. Since sales for my game have pretty much flatlined, doing something dramatic like this is an attractive option.

However, in the past, I've seen that participating in this kind of massive release of keys has resulted in a spike of third-party key resellers. These sites massively undercut the price of the game on Steam, but I can't seem to find any kind of hard data on how much grey-market impacts the short- or long-term health of indie games.

Has anybody seen any resources on this? How would you even go about measuring it? Have you ever taken advantage of this kind of key reseller? I'd be particularly interested to hear your story if you're part of the non-US market (which has been ~50% of the sales so far).


**Update edit:**
Thanks for the comments, everyone.
After some discussion with them, 1) we're going to be paid for the keys and 2) according to their analysis, their past deals of this type actually had very few keys end up on reseller sites (and some basic sleuthing on my part supports them). This is due in large to their particular business model and who ends up with the keys; the lesson is that not all large key give distributions are made equal. I'll post a writeup of the whole thing after it goes live.","Third party key resellers -- how much do they impact ""real"" sales?"

###About Me###

Hello! My name is Andrew and I'm working on a pet project of mine called C.A.R.L. under my new self-publishing label, Two-Bit Interactive. I've built the game as it stands today from the ground up on my own, including design/programming/art/music/writing, the works! :)

I'm working on C.A.R.L. during nights and weekends outside of my day job. I've been working as a C# game engineer for about 3 years now, but I've been a hobbyist for more than 10. 

*****

###About C.A.R.L.###

My earliest prototypes for this concept date all the way back to early 2013 - I've been toying around with this game for a while! However, earlier this year, I decided to settle on a final roadmap and set off to finish the game. Last week, I revealed the title with a new trailer and published the game on Steam Greenlight.

The game is a sort of love-letter to classic PC platformers from the early DOS days to the mid 00's. My biggest inspirations came from Cave Story, Speedy Eggbert, and Jazz Jackrabbit. In C.A.R.L., I hope to launch a title with a great balance of puzzle-solving, classic platforming gameplay, and a rich narrative with memorable personalities.

###Thanks!!###

IndieGaming,"Welcome to our weekly self promotion megapost. These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.

Here's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.

Each top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.

Like with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.

Because the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:

  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  
  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   
  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project

IndieGaming,"Hey everyone!
So I am planning an alpha for my multiplayergame next month. My game is probably halfway through development, so a lot of the mechanics are still flexible. My main objective is gathering feedback, and testing the networking.

I am wondering the most effective way to coordinate the alpha schedule. I haven't been pushing the alpha a huge amount yet, and am on pace to have approx 200 signups. If I leave the servers up for a weekend, then it may be hard for users to find games consistently, but if I choose very small time blocks (6pm-12pm, for 3 straight nights), I may alienate certain users/regions.

Have any of you had success/failure at launching a multiplayer alpha for its users?

IndieGaming,"An enormous blowout of news from the Starr Mazer​ universe is upon us!

Imagos Softworks​' upcoming retro-sexy universe is now not only being published by Japan based Playism​, but also coming to the PlayStation​ 4, Vita, Xbox​ One, Nintendo​ 3DS &amp; Wii U, will be going into early access next month and is being cheered on by the Gears of War 4 development team of The Coalition Studio​.

Conceived as a passing feature for a scene in Don Thacker’s 2013 creative feature film, Motivational Growth, and successfully Kickstarted on 21st February, 2015, Starr Mazer is an upcoming retro-modern fusion of the Point N’ Click and Shoot ‘Em Up genres that was originally due for a summer release this year.

Featuring modern game-play brainwaves such as the unpredictability of narrative unfolding and sophisticated role playing elements, the tale of a DSP Mk. II pilot — that wakes up amid an intense bout of amnesia in the aftermath of the galactic GREAT WAR and sets out to unravel the mysteries of his universe — was postponed when the fleshing out of the team’s self-developed content creation tool Mazer Maker consumed more time than was originally estimated.

Meanwhile, a prequel SHMUP Starr Mazer: DSP is being co-developed with Pixel Jam games and is due for an October 2017 release.

Come grab the complete roundup of news from the blowout and be sure to cheer the team on at - http://www.highereg.com/starr-mazer-partners-with-playism-announces-early-access-console-release/

IndieGaming,"We all played games when we were very young, how did we all of a sudden decide to start making our own games? We all have different stories, and here I want to tell mine.

There are 2 conditions that met so that I could decide to make games: 1.- I had to program at my job (but mostly FORTRAN) , 2.- I loved playing videogames (original silent hill is my favorite game). I started writing a C++ game. It was a copy of the snake game, using the allegro library. It was a very simple game, but that was the first step I took, and I was proud of it when I saw it was possible. I would post a snapshot here, but that was a few years ago and I don't have it anymore.

Then I learnt of pygame. I was already using python for some stuff, so I read a couple of books, and then set my mind to do a 2D short game with a simple mechanic. Here I show a video of that little game. I did everything, including the music and the drawings. I called it Throw me a Line, because you basically throw lines at the enemies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CymJWZyjg7c

I was happy I was making my own games. And I was surprised at how these libraries made everything much easier.

Then I wanted to learn how to manage 3D space. So I went into learning OGRE. Again I read a couple of books, but then I didn't have anyone to help me with 3D models and I didn't want to do a programmers' art game. I wanted something that would look nice, so I gave it a rest.

As a present for my nephews, though, I made another game, featuring them, or at least my no-talent version of them. Again I made the drawings and some of the music, the rest I ripped off a local band where I played for a short while, so that music also belonged to me and I had a talented friend write some small pieces for me. Here is a video of that little game. This time it included levels, energy bars for the enemies and a bit more features than the previous one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQGcluY8Wc

That was it, that's what I did on my own before I found a partner who told me about Unity and asked for help with a game he was working on. He is an artist with a little programming knowledge. So I fixed the game scripts and got it running. I got excited and told him I could help him see the game through. He said yes. This person I'm talking about is my brother by the way. Then I brought my music guy on board. He's been my best friend for over 10 years.

Currently we are three in the team, the scripting guy (me), the artist and the musician. Being that the situation, we sometimes need to outsource the work. But we are going steadily forward and we are close to releasing the first demo. We've been working hard since February 2016.

So this is my story. I would like to hear yours.

Finally I'll add a link to the Steam concepts page of the game we are currently working on. If you have a chance take a look and leave a comment so that we improve our game. Thanks!

",How I started developing games. My story.
IndieGaming,"We're a 2-person game studio trying to bring a really deep work of interactive fiction to iOS. We launched Timecrest 1 in September which was included in Apple's Apple Watch Best of 2015 and recommended by The New York Times.

We just launched Timecrest 2 today which adds 4 novels worth of content (bringing it up to 170,000 words) of choose-your-own-adventure style gaming to iPhone and iPad. You can optionally play on Apple Watch if you have one of those.

The reason we wanted to make this is because we felt that we wanted a really epic scale interactive fiction on the app store, and had a really incredible story to tell. And because we wanted to tell a story about time travel. :) We really enjoyed other interactive fiction apps out there, but they tended to be one character trying to survive one scene, where you choose wrong, and you instantly die. We felt that interactive fiction can have much more subtle changes in the world in addition to the big ones.

We wanted to build a huge world with dozens of locations to explore, many characters to meet, and decisions that have long reaching impacts. For example, certain avoidable character deaths in Chapter 4 can lead to story changes all throughout chapters 6-10. There's also a relationship system, where certain scenes will unlock, depending on how nice or mean you are to the characters you meet. There's also a non-linear map system in later chapters that allow you to explore the world freely while still enjoying a narrative with twists, turns and mysteries.

&gt; Alyncia is about to be destroyed by meteors.

&gt; When it seems that all hope is lost for this magical world, a young mage named Ash establishes a connection with you. To the surprise of you both, you find that you have the power to alter time in Alyncia.

I started up a blog where indie developers, studios, and game artists can submit their work to help get exposure for themselves called [The Game Hype](http://thegamehype.com/). Not only is their content on the web, but is shared via multiple social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit if within the guidelines of the sub, etc.) This blog is still VERY small, but wanted to share this to show what I've been working on.

I also plan to offer playing the game and sharing it via YouTube and Twitch when I can, but this hasn't taken off yet.

I was hoping I could get some feedback on not only my blog's ideal, but on tips to create a better interface with contributing. Currently I am using WordPress, meaning I have to check every post manually even though users have full contribution privileges I customized via a plugin. It's not the BEST submission procedure, so I KNOW it needs tweaking. Bots for automating the process of editing/checking would be nice but I'm lost in this field.

Hi folks, I'm an active community member with Atmosphir/Troposphir/OneMoreBlock, where we've been working hard to revive an indie game we feel deserves more attention and activity because of the endless possibilities one can make with this game.

[You can view a video demonstrating the game here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaU0-3FgPDg)

[Atmosphir](http://atmosphir.com) is a free 3D adventure hybrid game and design tool for Mac and PC. Originally created in 2009 by Minor Studios and shut down in 2012, it has been unofficially revived by its community at [OneMoreBlock](http://onemoreblock.com) through an open source project called Troposphir. Now with a new custom server for sharing levels and in-game multiplayer, users can continue to solve puzzles, jump through obstacles, fight enemies, and collect secret treasures in thousands of unique user-created levels, whether solo or with a friend. Since we've gotten all the major functionality back, we're in search of more creative individuals to participate in our friendly community and design some more amazing levels on top of a great catalog of pre-existing ones.

Making levels is as easy as clicking on a block (a platform, enemy, locked door, etc.) and snapping it onto a grid. Atmosphir's design mode requires no prior programming or design knowledge - if you've played with building blocks before, you can make compelling games. Atmosphir's level database is filled with thousands of diverse, exciting levels created by designers all over the world. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a first-time gamer, Atmosphir has something for everyone to enjoy. Plenty of beginner and tutorial levels help introduce you to the world and controls without worrying about time or lives, while expert levels will push the limits of 3D platforming difficulty. When you've finished your own masterpiece, upload it with a screenshot and description. Then share it with your friends and family online! Players can rate and comment on your level, helping it move up the ranks and get the attention it deserves. Easily join up with your friends or other community members in competitive-style battles across your own designed levels, or cooperatively play together in specifically designed levels that test your teamwork skills. Atmosphir is not a virtual world or glorified 3D chat room - it's a game first and foremost, with a small but passionate and dedicated following. The game wouldn't still be around without its fans, and while development is minimal/limited, we'll always be working to improve the game and experience.

If any of this interests you, please come visit us and download the game at http://www.onemoreblock.com/landing. Our [forum](http://onemoreblock.com/forum) and [Discord chat channel](https://discord.me/onemoreblock) are great places to meet the community, learn more about the game, and share your creations and passions with us. We look forward to meeting you soon!

**Jennifer Ann's Group is a nonprofit charity preventing teen dating violence.** Our most successful program is the production of video games designed specifically to reach young people and help them identify a potentially unhealthy relationship. We have been producing these video games since 2008 through an annual game design challenge and today we are releasing the winning games from our 2016 competition.

These games - like all of the games we've produced - are 100% free to play, download, and share. Our goal is to provide helpful information to young people as well as free resources for educators and for parents who are looking for a way to begin a conversation with their teens and tweens.

Since today's release includes four games I'm providing their details below rather than creating multiple links (please let me know if this is not the proper approach).

And ... since we've been doing this for a while now it might be helpful to anticipate some comments and address them proactively:

- Teen dating violence affects all genders. Some of our games only show male-as-abuser but we also have games that show female-as-abuser as well as abuse in same-sex dating relationships. The purpose of our group is to prevent dating abuse regardless of gender.

- The way that ""game"" is defined has evolved over time. Not all of our games are equally ""game-ish"" but that's okay. Since all of our games are free we hope that you'll find one that resonates with you.

- We believe - strongly - that games can be used for many things. Although the media seems to focus more on potential negative aspects of video games we know (and have done the research) that games have the ability to change: attitudes in a positive way; increase awareness about important issues; and educate young people.

IndieGaming,"Hey, i have managed to make a (beta) demo of my game **Pharmakon**.

It's a turn based puzzle-tactics about drone management.

[You can download a demo here on its itch.io page.](https://visumeca.itch.io/droneagent)

I'm working alone on that project since February 2015.
I learned to code with that project.
It's made with Monogame.

It's a game i wanted to be (almost) as simple as chess with a wide amount of problem solving possibilities.

Any kind of feedback is greatly appreciated.


-----------------------------------------------------------

The game is subject to changes coming after playtest sessions.

Gameplay of the game will not change but i am still balancing difficulty and combats.
And content will be added or removed according to relevant feedbacks.

For now, there is no music, no sound fx, there's only story background instead of full story and traduction is approximate (i'm french).
And the game lacks a bit of staging.

-----------------------------------------------------------

How to play : Use Mouse to play.

Drag and drop pieces on drone to equip it and increase its power.
Target beast you want to attack and click again on the target selected to launch the attack. You can also click on the green button on the command.
Click on drone's damage to repair them with repairs you have.

IndieGaming,"I'm the Solo Dev for my first game, Marblize, and I've proudly worked on it for just over a year and I'm trying to get my name out there. If you have any questions or feedback about it, I'd be glad to answer it.

*About the game*

Marblize is a physics-based puzzler platformer game where you play as a marble and you explore levels and solve puzzles. I wanted to build a game that combines the fun of platformer-styled games with building obstacles and hazards, with puzzle elements and logic devices to make a nice combination of challenge and fun. If you like to see screenshots, I have a couple [here](http://imgur.com/a/ViVkb) to look at.

IndieGaming,"My name is Acidhedz, and I am the developer of this game. I have been working on it off and on, adding and tweaking things, for about a year. And I would like to tell you about it because I really want you to play my game, and give me your money.
It is an RPG Maker VXACE based game.
My primary disciplines are writing and music. So that is where most of my work is placed. It features an original soundtrack.

The Adventure of F***face is a comedy RPG.
My influences as a writer are people like Stanley Kubrick, Terry Pratchett, Robert Asprin, Mel Brooks, Hunter S Thompson, and HP Lovecraft.
Plus stand up comedy, and tons of other things.

Story: F***face, who is not a spoof of anyone famous, is at a Las Vegas gaming and youtube convention. Just because. He gets kidnapped by a wizard who takes him to a fantasy land in the far flung future, in order to rescue a princess. Just because.
Hilarity ensues.

Loaded with all sorts of jokes. Parody and satire (especially of classic RPGs and fangames), puns and wordplay, political humor, incongruity based humor, highly offensive sex jokes, and much more!
I'm partial to the books of funny spells myself. Who wouldn't want to go into battle using a ""Spray of Vaseline""?

The game is made to appeal at several layers. The battles are challenging. The story is interesting (well, I think it is of course). There are tons of obvious jokes. But also plenty of things for those who like to explore and dig deeper.
The story has several interpretations, depending on how you want to look at it.

You can purchase the game on Gamejolt for 6.90$

Now here's everything I can recall:
&amp;nbsp;

- The main protagonist wears a futiristic helmet displaying seemingly random images or ""holograms"".
&amp;nbsp;

- It's an isometric shooter with melee combat.
&amp;nbsp;

- I think the player has the possibility to perform ""dash moves"" to evade enemy attacks or solve light puzzle and platforming elements.
&amp;nbsp;

- The setting was dystopian, futuristic and cyberpunk-esque.
&amp;nbsp;

- I've already seen a couple of gameplay videos on several YouTube channels like IGN and whatnot.
&amp;nbsp;

- I am not entirely sure if it's an indie game but it had an ""indie vibe"" to it.

","Self Promotion Megapost, 15 August 2016"
IndieGaming,"Back in 2010, two friends in Brisbane named Peter and Stephen had the idea to start making games together. Peter was an artist and Stephen was a programmer so it was a perfect fit. This might sound like a common story with games such as Super Meat Boy also being made by two people, however this article will show that Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes were the exception, not the rule.

Peter and Stephen decided to ply their trade under the name Roguebox with a focus on creating mobile games. Shortly thereafter they began work on a stealth game and multiple iterations later the first title from Roguebox was finally released earlier this year. It was for that reason the guys were promoting the then soon to be released game at RTX Australia, and I recently caught up with Stephen Berg, programmer and designer of Rogue Agent, to see how the last six months had gone for them.

After the obvious 'how have things been?' question it quickly became apparent that Rogue Agent was effectively dead in the water. It didn't help that the game was switched over to a free-to-play model after release, but it was a necessary move never-the-less.

""The decision to go free to play happened for a few reasons:

1) It is very hard to sell a premium game now. 

2) Our piracy rate was insane. On launch our analytics for the iOS version showed we had 18,000 users on the first weekend but when sales data came in, we found that 96% of those did not pay for the game. We found that we got small spikes of sales with articles and media coverage but everything had died off after 2 weeks (because we fell completely out of any charts etc).

I have no idea the piracy rate on android (we added analytics later) but for iOS it was 96%. I am guessing Android would have been worse. Within days we found a lot of sites with our game APK and OBB files up for download. It was a little heartbreaking but felt it was good we made a game worth stealing.

To try and hotshot ourselves back into the rankings we dropped the price from $2.99 USD to $0.99 USD for 2 weeks (starting Feb 1st - less than 2 weeks after release). Our sales did spike back up but in less than a week we went right back down to 4-5 sales a day. We did get another spike when Touch Arcade did a review (awarding 4 stars).

For the next few months (until April) I would try and give away promo codes on Touch Arcade and generally we would get 2-3 sales for every promo code we gave out. We decided to try another flash sale at $1 on April 6th (for 48 hours) which again gave a very small spike of a mere 24 sales.

In desperation we thought we could generate some word of mouth by giving Rogue Agent away for free so on April 10th we made the game free for 24 hours and moved 23,000 units. Upon returning to paid we had zero sales (this was a big failure but was what made us think free to play may be a better option).

On April 30th we made Rogue Agent free with Ads (and we disabled ads for people with existing save games - ie: people that already purchased the game). Downloads started at 9000+ per day and fell down over the next week to rest at 80-100 per day. The numbers seem good but in money terms - the ad revenue at peak was $70 per day and now, in August, we generate &lt; $5 per day with 80-100 users per day (with the occasional spike for 200 people).""

Being the first game to come out of the studio, especially considering the six year that had gone into it, that would have been a very bitter pill to swallow.

""We should have recognised our market and made a simpler game with procedural content that we could have shipped in 6 months. We also should have planned for free with ads and IAP straight away. The decision to switch hurt all the momentum we had. It is very hard to make money on mobile games and generally you need to get a few out before one achieves success. Sadly we sunk too much into Rogue Agent and we were never going to get back enough money that it was a successful game.""

As you can see Stephen is quite up front about the whole thing, but there was a small silver lining to the situation. The feedback from critics and the general public has been positive for the most part.

""We have gotten very positive responses from critics (Touch Arcade, App Advice, Cult of Mac etc) and the public (RTX). We do feel we made a great game. We are proud of what we did even though it was financially unsuccessful.""

In relation to RTX Australia specifically, which was also the studio's first convention, I asked Stephen what his opinion was of the event and whether a small indie team with a limited budget can benefit from exhibiting there.

""I think RTX was not really our target market. The main question we got was ""When can I get this on Steam?"". I wish we had launched on PC as well as mobile. I would be curious how many sales we got initially were from RTX attendees. As mentioned, being active on the touch arcade forums helped keep sales slightly alive. My best recommendation for people would be to try and be active on social media and online in general. That is free. We spent more money going to RTX and buying merchandise than Rogue Agent made in sales.""

So where does that leave Roguebox now you ask?

""Sadly, we are probably done with Roguebox Studios. We will be keeping Rogue Agent up for download though and social media and the website are still alive. I (Stephen Berg) have gone to Spunge Games (as a Programmer) and am working on Faily Brakes now (I have been there for the last 3 months). Peter Anthony continues to develop games independently but won't be releasing them under Roguebox Studios.""

Being an indie dev appears more and more to be fraught with danger. It's an interesting direction that the industry seems to be going in. The indie mega booth seems to be the holy mecca for small teams to get noticed, but as conventions try to squeeze more and more games onto the show floor is it still really worth it? 

Just as fast as you have indie developers trying to get into conventions you have others trying to get out, such is the case with Devolver Digital and their annual shanty town that goers up at E3. It's a crazy time to be in game development because nobody knows what the future holds. Steam and the App Store have become flooded with the shear volume of games being produced now and getting noticed is arguably harder than ever.

Hello! I am very new to indie gaming. (Just subscribed today actually) I am developing a basketball clothing company. Knowing how competitive the field is I need to do things to market my company. I am very focused, and passionate. I understand the many uses a video game cane possess. Back when the Playstation 2 and XBOX were the top 3 systems there was always options for a street basketball game. And 1 even had a basketball game that marketed their basketball clothing company! I really like the model they used for the game. The game is obviously very outdated, but I wanted to create a similar game using my ideas to correct where I think they could have done better. And tap into the street basketball video game market that has gone unfed for 10 years now. What I'm asking is how plausible it is to assemble a team, start a go fund me, possibly aquire the rights to former street basketball video games to be able to use their mechanics, and get product placement. I do not know any coding, I am not knowledgeable, but I know there are very smart people on reddit, and if you guys could give me a picture on the road (which will be crazy hard but im willing to do crazy.)

IndieGaming,"Hi guys. 

Currently I am living in Seoul. I study here as an exchange student, and I have recently attended  G-NEXT Game Jam about a week ago. It’s a game jam that is organized at the Startup Campus in in Pangyo Gyeonggi-do, South-Korea. I must say that the games that I saw at the game jam were quite amazing. The Korean developers really are one of the most creative ones I have seen. 

Fairplay was one of the games that stood out for me. It was the most polished and most fun game at the event. It’s a game that is most definitely inspired by the Rio Olympics and the thought behind it: ‘play fair’. The characters of the game looked very cute and even though it was a simple button masher game, it managed to be exciting. I played a weightlifting game, a swimming game and a running game during the demo. I loved it. 

When you’re in Korea, definitely check out the indie scene here. It’s quite amazing to experience it.",Gamejam! :-)

IndieGaming,"Hello /r/IndieGaming.

I finished my last project a month or so ago, so I have taken a little break, and looking to start something new. I took part in a Colour themed game jam last weekend, and this was the output: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc_aGAfDz7I 

Colour switching is the key mechanic. You need to be the right colour to defend yourself and to attack. I want to also implement colour based portals to navigate through some light mazes. Music and sound has also been linked to the colours, so would like to enhance this to provide some audio gratification when you get your colours right.

The scoring is also going to be geared towards the precision of your colour selection.

It is very tempting to make this thing procedural/infinite, but I am going to go for hand crafted levels and bosses.

I am a solo dev, so art will mainly be my own, thus the initial ""retro"" look and feel :D but I had help on the sound music during the jam, and hopefully they will still be involved as the game goes forward.

So, what does the community think? Worth a bit more work?",Should I pursue this prototype any further?

IndieGaming,"[Initium](https://www.playinitium.com/login.jsp?game=YXNrX2FfZHV0Y2hAaG90bWFpbC5jb20_) is a MUD-like RPG where every item is unique (it'll scratch that Diablo itch), incorporating a huge world, PvP and availability on every major platform including your phone. It features a roguelike feel and dungeoncrawler mechanics such as permadeath, as well as a 100% player driven economy (no NPCs), randomised character stats and a D&amp;D combat system.

While I have only been in the community for 2 months, the game has been going strong for over a year now, and the player-base is extremely helpful. If you drop in, give a shoutout to my handle (Dutchman) in global chat and I'll set you up with some gear if I'm around (and if not, someone else definitely will).

The wonderful thing about this game is the amazing memories the community creates. Here is a few of my favourites:

* Going to rescue a new player who got overconfident and died to the orc shaman. I did not have the gear to beat the Shaman myself, so I messaged Second Wave and someone (I forgot who, let me know!) showed up JUST TO HELP SAVE A NEW PLAYER. The new guy went premium to allow a rescue, and I took him back to Aera. Feel good inc.

* A friend died in the bottom of troll cave, while he was fighting the TK and I watched it happen. The TK killed him, but there were too many corpses in the room to find him. After some digging, I realised he was not there, but in the room prior (but we can no longer backtrack from TK!). So, three of us fought all the way back down through the troll cave to rescue the poor guy from under a gargantuan pile of troll corpses outside the TK's lair. We made it before he bled out, and it was crazy intense for a MUD.

* Getting my flatmate into the game. Elora is not much of a gamer but plays regularly now. However, instead of the way you and I may play she spends 99% of her time in the Aera marketplace playing the economy (to the extend to which this exists). Finance students, go figure.

* The generosity of some of the new players. A new guy/girl (Europa) started playing the other day and found a bronze shield in the inn. They were super excited, and had no idea about the 'relatively' low value of the shield. When he offered it for sale, Argus bought the thing off him for 15k (which became apparent when he asked if 15k was enough to buy a house). Europa bought a house and some starter gear and said they felt incredibly supported and welcomed by the community. These moments are fantastic. (Argus, you are awesome).","Initium is a browser based MUD-like RPG: f2p, not pay-to-win, with substantial endgame and receiving substantial updates constantly"

IndieGaming,"While studying Unreal Engine 4, I worked on a prototype. In three months it was beginning to look like a game, and I continued evolving it for more 10 months, working on it one or two hours after working about 10 hours on my bad payjob. I wasn't really happy. After one year in this routine, a political and economical crisis hit Brazil pretty hard, and suddenly I didn’t had a job anymore. It was kind of good because I wanted to finish my game, but first I had to settle something that were worrying me; the steam greenlight.

I read on the Internet some developers saying that the greenlight was easy to pass, others saying that the game was already over 1 year with no prospect of approval. Imagine after working for two years the game not being approved? It must be a nightmare. I plucked up some courage and decided that before going into full production I would send the game to greenlight.

The first thing was settle a name for the game. I already had a list of some words and names, and in the end I choose “Enigma Prison”. Its not a good name that everyone would want it, and not that bad that would ruin the game. I took some screenshots of the game, made a temporary cover art with a screenshot of the main menu (which had a very simple version of the character at the time) with the name of the game and I recorded some footage for a trailer.

In the early hours, the game was receiving equal amounts of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ (more no’s to tell the truth), I could not sleep so I turned to dawn observing how people reacted. It didn’t seemed to be going very well. I started to read the comments and realized that many people were complaining that the trailer was in total silence, of course, it was true. The game was in early production and had no music and were missing many sound effects too. How could I get a song for my trailer in a few hours if I have no money to invest in it? Searching on google I found that many artists share their music free licenses if you credit them, and sites like ‘youtube audio library’ you can find some free music that can be used in videos and trailers, so I heard it all, got a song that worked a little with the style of the game, put it on the trailer without making any changes and updated the greenlight. It was when things started to work. Magically the game began to receive a huge amount of yes votes and compliments on the comments, then I learned my first lesson: listen to the public. The game was flying high; 70% 50% 20%, got in the top 100 and kept rising. I could hardly contain my joy of having my work built with blood and sweat next to being approved.
Reading the comments at this point had something bothering me; There was a lot of comments saying that my game seemed like a Portal 3. My game is definitely in the same category of Portal, but the proposal is quite different. Portal have this very amazing storytelling and humor, and my game is much more focused on gameplay, crazy technology and open world, I was concerned that would create a different expectation and confuse the players. I talked to some friends they all said that this was a very good thing, and that the game would not disappoint any Portal fan. They said I should embrace this idea and even use this to explain the game.

Then on the fourth day, around 6 pm, the game was still climbing, currently among the top 10 of the 1,761 greenlight was interrupted with the approval. Certainly one of the happiest days of my life.

This happened a year ago, since then I have worked tirelessly in the game and finally the open beta is now available on Steam with a with a fairly good number of downloads.

IndieGaming,"So, I've posted here on and off about a MetroidVania I'm making.  I'm changing the format a bit of the game, trying to add my own unique spin to it or whatever, and I wanted to run an idea by you guys who play a lot of them:

It has RPG Elements, Items to find, customizable builds, etc, and on top of those things, it's also going to have...

... a super mario style overworld map.  Each ""area"" can be walked over once you finish it start to finish a la mario world, or you can go back to it to try to find alternate exits or items you've missed, which in turn will unlock hidden paths across the overworld to other areas.

Thoughts on this?

Personally, I think it'll make the player want to find a path to each interesting looking point on the map (maybe there'll be paths to not so interesting points on the map too!).

(roughly the order I said them in, during my 30 minutes play session)  

&gt;[Pausing to look at the sky] Wow...now that's a planet

If you look at [this](http://www.osirisnewdawn.com/#) page, you can see a ringed, blue planet in the back ground. That was the back drop for the world I was playing on. Looks like a Gas Giant with rings. I asked the devs, and we were on a moon, orbiting said gas giant. Planets sound like they might be scaled down so you can explore all of them in a semi-reasonable time. 3-4 hours to travel around them. **Again, this was pre-early access build, so that could change**. The planet it semi-procedural. IE: they build the foundation of the planet with tools, then use procedural generation to fill in the blanks, and add aging and weathering effects on the land scape. A designers hand is placing most of the larger land marks.

&gt;FUCK YOU SPIKY BUSH

Even when the terrifying aliens are leaving you be (they don't seem to agro during the day unless you go after them), the environment isn't all too friendly. I managed to puncture a few holes in my space suit by running headlong into what was basically and oversized ~~sea~~ urchin. Had to patch up with repair tape quickly or risk losing my all my air (think: The Martian).

&gt;Oh, I can build a normal wall...a reinforced wall, a window...a connector wall...a...[uh oh...](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/09/17/mine-all-mine-part-one)

When you build your habitats, you just build the frames to start out with, then you have to go add the walls as you wish. Meaning I could build a Hab with all windows, all normal walls, all connectors to web out to various other modules. I didn't stay around long enough to try and build all the other modules, but there was a lot of variety, and you can plan and build your own base camp pretty openly. The Dev there was more than happy to Cheat-in a bunch of materials for me to build what I was trying to at the time though.


&gt;[asking the Dev sitting next to me] uh, hey, where can I put this lead down? I can't use it yet, and I can't go mine for more iron with it all weighing me down

Elements are all ""real"" elements from our world, and their weight characteristics seem to be tied to reality also. I couldn't pick up nearly as much lead as I could Iron or Aluminum, so inventory management has a ""realistic"" point there. Luckily I could just drop the lead on the floor of my Hab, and go get the Iron I wanted. I was surprised and then happy they went with a weight restricted inventory. You can build rovers to driver farther, and carry more materials back to your basecamp.


&gt;AUUGH, Who put AvP in my Space engineers?!?

The aliens in the game were literally terrifying. They are designed by hand, not randomly, and there movement is very natural. I was trying to put the walls on a T-junction to my habitat, I was suddenly attacked by a creature that would have fit pretty well along side the monster from ""Stranger things"" (I mentioned to the dev sitting next to me and he got a good laugh, he was a fan of the show as well).  
I had to pull out the Rifle and unloaded a clip or so of ammo into the horrific creatures running around my camp. My Laser piston was pretty weak, so I had finite rifle ammo to worry about. The gun play felt like any standard FPS. It was like I went from space engineers to Halo as soon as I switched to my rifle. I didn't last long during this encounter, so I didn't get much time with the gun, admittedly.

---

I was only at PAX for 1 day, and had other places I still wanted to get to, so after about 20 minutes, when the space monsters from hell killed me as night fell, I got up and let someone else play. A few other notes from my time.

It LOOKS fantastic.  
Realistic, yet vibrant color pallet. Great texture quality (though I didn't do much wall licking). 

Multiple ""classes"" of character  
Engineer, Marine, Scientist, and Ranger.  
**Engineer was the only playable class, at the demo** but the classes list described how it tweaks how efficient you are in various ways. Marine is better for combat. The Ranger could better make do with his surroundings if he got stranded far away from his base camp. Engineer was quicker to build things. Scientist I think could learn more from the environment, maybe advance his tech faster. There are (I think) 5 skills you level up as you use them. The starting point for each is different between classes I believe

You can build some pretty smart drones to keep you company 
Start of the Demo there was a large drone (large riding lawn mower sized) hanging around that you could give commands to. I saw someone else using it a bit more. It could mine for you I believe, go fight for you, not sure what else. The pop up commands included things like flanking right or left on attack...so there is a decent level AI built in to the drones-friends.

Multiplayer/co-op  
2 factions you can choose between. They are shooting for up to 30 player instances. You can work with people in your faction to build a huge colony, and battle against the other faction as they do the same.

This is not your typical zombie game. You are the zombie, build an army of undead allies and reign havoc on the city. The city realistically reacts to the outbreak as it would in real life. Civilians will call the police on you and military units will be dispatched. You can literally aquire massive armies of zombies that will follow you threw the city!

Right now there's no playable demo. There will be high scores on the iOS implemented with Game Centre and Gamejolt's API for html5 scores.

** VOTE LINK: https://www.cryengine.com/development-fund/projects/darkness-anomaly **

Now let me tell you a few things about the game =)
*Darkness Anomaly is a thrilling and innovative open world horror game, with an unique technique of exploring and story telling that we came up with. You will experience the horror on a whole new level. With realistic environment, event-tracking, an amazing storyline in which you make the decisions and its required to pay attention to every little detail in this game! We've created an amazing story combined with some breathtaking atmosphere. And i think we have a shot here to create an amazing game!

It all starts with Aaron. Through the years , with Lights accumulated knowledge on occult religions. Trough his strong aura, he was able to collect followers and build a cult to summons Vassago trough a ritual by killing three people and steal Vassago's might to order to pursue his ideology.

This becomes a big thing in the small town, Kingdom Valley. For the local police, it is too much to handle, so they ask for help for the next big city, Cleveland. Where Nick Revees is a successful detective. To solve this case, he's the one who was sended out to Kindgom Valley for his prehistory with this town. Nick was born in Kingdom Valley. He grew up, with his voilent alcohol addict father. So he moved away and became a detective.
As Vassago's might will be stolen, he tries aswell to save the humanity he learned to love trough years. He ask's Nick, to help him to get his might back. And at this point, a mind game battle starts between Nick, Light and Vassago. To gain more power, Light has to sacrifice 7 people in the name of the deadly sins.
Thats where the gameplay comes in. As the player, you have to solve this 7 cases to get near to Light. To uncover his identity and to be able to fight against him with Vassago's help.

You enter the world of Kindgom Valley by your own. You have your motel where you sleep, the bar, the police station and the whole city to explore aswell as the wood parts of the town. Your first case as the player, will be a dead woman found in an alley. As you follow the hints the body left. You encounter strange things happening to you. (thats where the horror comes in). You will find out that the soul of this dead woman, slowly becomes a manifistation of the deadly sin she made in her life. She becomes a lost soul. A being of pure will to get back to life, by taking yours. To prevent this, you have to find out who she was, what she did and why she did. To decide at the end which sin it was and weak the power of the lost soul to encounter her in a fight.
To be able to find out information about the killed people. You have to become a detective by yourself as the player. By asking the citizens of the town, by solving puzzles in an oldisch way. In some cases you have to act by yourself and not only in the game to solve cases. Righting things down, searching for things in books or the internet. Aswell as note every little thing and every little thing that people will say just by sitting in bar. Like in one case, on a dead body, there will be writting ""My one regret in life is that I am not someone else."" This has something to do with the case and the story. Later in the game, in a bar someone will mention ""that in the town, someone is a big Woody Allen Fan"" So thats your option, weither you ignore it, or you search this saying and you will find out that, thats actually a Woody Allen Quote. So are you gonna ask the people about the Woody Allen Fan? Or will you just ignore it? Its up to you. You are the detective you decide what to do.
Aswell as you got a badge. You a detective. By asking out people in the town, you will be able to get the right anwser out of people or get the truth by, showing your badge where is needed, or maybe, to ask friendy is the right way? On this decision the whole conversation takes its own turning. Someone can get angry if you show the badge, in that case you can put your hands on the holster of you weapon? Maybe that will calm them down. Or not","Help us get funded, with only a vote! No donations! Darkness Anomaly, Open World Horror made with CRYENGINE. Indie Development Fund"

**Background on me and my brother**

So my brother and I have been making games since High School  and I think we've came a long way from our first app, we're both seniors in college now. ([Our first app was a random number generator that wasn't actually random..](http://i.imgur.com/LBH7GgE.jpg))

Anyways, we eventually moved into making games and that is were our true passion resides. We love making fun and free games that everyone can enjoy and we really work hard to release a fully functioning and polished product before it's released.

Isn't this game just a Flappy Bird clone? It definitely has similarities but the game really has a lot more to it and I hope that you realize this once you put some time into it. Our game before this one was a completely original game (spent over a year of our time on it..) but the downfall of it was that it was far too complex for the average user so we decided to make something a little more familiar this time around.

[Kickstarter Link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samorkai/vulture-capitalist-the-video-game)


Vulture Capitalist is an RPG in the mold of the classic Pokemon games but it takes place in an 8bit Silicon Valley and you battle and acquire Startups instead of Monsters. The inspiration for the game came from our idea to make an RPG about white collar crimes that could provide real world commentary and tie-in's. 

You play as a young venture capitalist and you acquire and battle startups against competitors. Every day you gain income from your startups which you use to acquire more startups (usually after you take down their value in battle). We want the game to have a strong story line but also to be broad enough where you can play it over and over again without it getting boring. 

As we started creating the game we thought of tons of cool features we wanted to add to make it even more awesome such as multiplayer support, using real life market data to factor into how your startups grow and to expand to different platforms. With all these new ideas we decided to make a Kickstarter to help us spend more time on the project and take it to the next level.

But something is worrying me: There's some ""popular"" crack sites distributing old versions of the game as ""full game"", and this is a bad thing because some people might play a version of 8 months ago and might get disappointed these versions are filled with problems that already were solved.

IndieGaming,"{{{SPOILERS}}} for those who haven't played these games...


These games have a 'turning point' where the player realizes that there is a layer of depth that goes far, far beyond the initial scope of the game.  They're all puzzle games, so perhaps this 'trope/mechanic' is limited to puzzles, but I was wondering if there's anything else out there that rings this kind of a bell.  The Witness does something similar, but not in the same way.

So I'm looking for any of the following:

1. Games with mechanics that literally alter the form of the game in some way or another.  In the three listed above, the tile-based nature of the game is disrupted dramatically.  In Corrypt, the game can become unplayable.

2.  Games with big, dramatic 'turning points' in which a mechanic (or if you're really struggling to think of any others, the tone or plot) is revealed that makes things you saw in the past (inaccessible rooms, unsolvable puzzles) make sense.

3.  Games with any big, explosive, ""Aha!"" moments.

Try to keep spoilers limited for folks who haven't played.

My name is Fernando and I’m releasing my first game, BalanCity, on Steam today!


[BalanCity on Steam] (http://store.steampowered.com/app/462680/)


**BalanCity** is a 2D side view city builder with physics simulation. You must build a towering city over a balancing platform while taking care of your citizens. Think of it as if the old SimCity and Jenga had a goofy love child.

[Screenshots](
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s8ytzbjsu3hj5hg/AADOvsRcx3qd_NDMrC3TB2E_a?dl=0)
 

 
BalanCity features dozens of different buildings to choose from, each one serving a different function in your city and, when you are fed up with your creation, a handful of disasters to cause mayhem such as earthquakes, monsters, asteroids and UFOs.
 
**The game features three play modes:**
 
* Free Build: A sandbox mode where you can build upwards without limits (just the laws of physics)
 
* Missions: Levels where you must achieve a certain goal with limited resources.
 
* Scenarios: Recreate eight real world capitals along with their famous landmarks (New York, San Francisco, Paris, London, Tokyo and more).




BalanCity is available on Steam for PC, Mac and Linux at $9.99 with a 20% launch discount.  
 


A mobile version is being developed and will be released in Fall 2016 for iOS and Android.
 
 


The game has been already played by thousands of players since the release of it’s demo in March for Steam Greenlight.
 


A simple YouTube search throws hundreds of gameplay videos. The most watched video was made by Youtuber Draegast with over 400k views 

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUvSnk6-AIg). 
 
It also got media attention with articles in Kotaku (http://steamed.kotaku.com/balancity-is-simcity-meets-jenga-1762239793/) and KillScreen (http://killscreen.com/articles/balancity-will-challenge-you-to-build-an-entire-city-on-a-seesaw/) among others.
 
BalanCity was nominated at the Best Latin American Game category at BIG (Brazil Independent Games) Festival 2016 in Sao Paulo and received a couple of local distinctions in it´s home Argentina.

Hey guys, me and my best friend are working hard for 4 years on a game project with no funds, with only will and passion.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**HEATHEN:**

""Heathen"" is an adventure, action and exploration game in an eerie world populated by freaks, with steam punk elements.
The game will be released in episodic content, and we plan to do at least 3 episodes.
The story takes place decades after the H.G Wells book and the player is a descendant of the doctor Moreaus's experiments. He will have to explore the places, discover the island story, and instill respect for the laws of Moreaux to all living souls.

The player will have to find a way through the island and discover its history since the death of Doctor Moreau. To achieve this, he will have to accomplish many different tasks, for example: use a compass to find his way, search for story pages, items and clues to resolve the riddles, and of course fight against opponents. The ultimate goal is to discover the spirit of the island, and to convert or destroy all living souls who have lost their humanity, including humans.

IndieGaming,"Hi everyone, I'm Mark, part of a team that's working on a game called Terroir.    

**The Game**   
Terroir is a game where you get put in charge of your own chateau and vineyard. You choose from a variety of different grape types, which allow to to craft different wines. You enhance the wine through processes like maceration and fermentation, but the most important factor of all is the weather and soil type, which can strongly affect the final product.    

To get a wine out to market, you first need to organize a wine tasting session with critics, whose ratings of your wine will affect how much you can sell it for. Then you've got the actual wine merchants, with whom you can build a relationship over time, granting you preferential terms.    The game also has a Cellar feature, where you can stock your wine for further enhancement, or in the case of particularly good vintages, withhold from the market in the hopes of increasing its value. 

**Who We Are**    
We are a group of made up of specialists in different fields, including a programmer and developer, a motion artist, a UI designer and a writer, among others. We're not an established studio or company - just a group of people who yearn for the days of classic business tycoon games and city builders like Theme Hospital and Caesar III. We've all got day jobs, but we dedicate the rest of our free time working on Terroir, which has been in production for more than 7 months. We hope you'll like it.

**What We Hope You'll Do**    
We hope you'll see potential in our game, which has just finished the alpha stage. We're now working on many more improvements, and we're excited to share that as we progress. In the meantime, what would really help us make this game a reality is if you head over to our [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=780071338) page and give us a ""YES"" vote if you think it deserves it. That would mean the world to us. The Greenlight page also has the TRAILER, a PLAYTHROUGH VIDEO, a few SCREENSHOTS and more information about the game, as well as links to our Facebook and YouTube pages.

Chris has been programming since he was small and Mark wants to focus his career on game audio, I make myself useful and make things look nice. ;) We're all from just about the same place and over summer we got back to some older projects and decided to focus up and actually finish something-- PoketoRoketo, from start to launch, took about 6-8 weeks to design. It's fun~.

**PoketoRoketo**

It's a simple arcade-style spaced-based shooter; there are some easter eggs and there's a cat piloting the ship (he's based on [my cat](http://i.imgur.com/Kr8Kfqz.png), his name is Juniper and he finds [life harrowing](http://i.imgur.com/7ADurrY.png).) The whole idea is to shoot incoming objects; it begins with the asteroids and as your score increases and the game progresses, comets spawn. There's a few hidden modes you can unlock, and more are forthcoming. There's a weapon which overheats if you fire too quickly, has a bit of a cool down timer and then you can resume.

IndieGaming,"Hi all! I'm co-founder of an indie studio called Crayon Ponyfish based in Orlando, Fl, and we are set to release a demo of our game this Saturday. We successfully funded our Kickstarter campaign and also just submitted our game to Steam Greenlight. I'm interested in hearing some feedback from this community about our sites and the look of our game. I'm excited to be able to share our demo this weekend as I think we've created a fun game that will have a lot of replay-ability.

A little about our game:

Lotia is a classic JRPG game that was built on the RPG Maker MV Platform, but with custom art, battlers, and UI assets. We also have an amazing original soundtrack written by Ryan McQuinn. We set out to create a game that involved a lot of aspects of games we enjoyed playing in our childhood such as Dungeons and Dragons, Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, and Ultima. Lotia has a rich and deep story that we feel will provide a lot of replay-ability for players to learn new things about the lore of Lotia.

In short, Lotia takes place in an oceanic dreamworld full of pirates, Phantasms, and the powerful Dominion who seek to conquer Lotia. You will set sail with Reef O'Meara, Captain of the Surprise, as he and his crew travel across the void oceans of Lotia trying to discover the truth of who they are and what is really going on in what was once considered a dreamer's paradise.

**Bugspeed Collider** is an air- and ground-based platform brawler where everything can be destroyed and tactical timing rules the day.

Our ""Arena"" campaign will allow for both co-operative and speed-run scenarios as you cut through hoards of the mysterious Dark Beetle Army. We also have ""Frenzy"" if you just want to see how many bugs you can squish, ""Training"" if you want to learn the finer points and concepts behind your capabilities, and ""Party"" if you don't care much for the rules and just want to start fighting right away.

IndieGaming,"Recently I reviewed a game called 3Souls for my Youtube channel, and it is an exclusive

game for the eShop that makes excellent use of gamepad. And 3Souls is kind of game that wouldn't work on other consoles... Well, maybe it could, but it just wouldn't be the same.

So let's see if we can have recommendations of games that make good use of the

gamepad, specially games that are not well-known.

I'm gonna start with a few eShop games that I know:

... 3Souls - This is a puzzle-platformer game, and you have to use the gamepad in a few different ways during the game. For example, you can control cameras and, in some parts, the game even tells you to use the gamepad camera to interact with the real world (I'm not telling how, since it would be a spoiler). Pretty cheap game too, so not a bad deal (just keep in mind, the game is kinda of hard, so it's for people who like puzzles). The also had an interesting plot. Here's my full review if you are interesting and seeing how the game looks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD1hfvT0teU

... Temple of Yog - I think this is an exclusive Wii U game. It's a dungeon crawler and you always need to keep an eye one the gamepad because you play in two different dimensions. Think Metroid Prime 2 or Zelda TP, but with both dimensions happening at the same, one on the TV and the other one on the gamepad. You can also choose from several different RPG type characters to play. Trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOzGeGkzWA

... Puddle - This game uses the gamepad motion controls is a great way. It's pretty much like Fluidity for the Wii and 3DS, but with a bigger variety of, well, fluids (some will catch fire, other are unstable and will explode if you're careful, etc). Trailer of the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCkgBptGLiw

... Little Inferno - It's a puzzle game that let's you burn stuff. It's also available on Steam, but I think the Wii U version is the way to go since you can actually burn touch the things you wanna burn. Trailer for the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwNSHINqNdo

... Human Resource Machine - Made by the same devs that made Little Inferno, in this game you have to drag and drop lines of codes to solve puzzles. It actually teaches you some programming skills. If you're not a programmer, this game is gonna pretty hard. But it's really fun. Actually, one of the best puzzle games I'ver played in my entire despicable life. About how the game uses the gamepad... Same thing, since you can touch everything, it's much better than playing with a mouse (yes, this game is also on Steam). Here's my full review of the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy0eUclj0-w

... Nihilumbra - Another great puzzle adventure game, also great for the gamepad since you have to draw stuff on the screen. I also reviewed it not long ago: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZpLAjQX5CU

... Affordable Space Adventures - You control a spaceship, and you have make sure the spaceship explode by managing its systems using the gamepad. High production values, great puzzle game overall. Trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O_n_fCBZac

... Art of Balance - Again another well-known indie game, but still worth mentioning. In this you title have to pile some geometrical pieces and, of course, everything works via the gamepad's touchscreen.

Dissonance is a game with a story that relies on how you work together with a mute, mysterious spirit. This spirit can potentially be of great use to you, but it isn't necessarily just a tool; it might have emotions, goals, or thoughts. Whether you treat it as such, however, is completely up to you.

Dissonance is in its very early stages of development, so much of this is subject to change.

And now a little marketing:
""Battle Crest Runner is our take on the classic, basic endless runner type game. BC Runner will take place in a familiar Battle Crest setting from medieval Europe.

BC Runner presents inter-app features which will be developed stronger over time – but fear not, the game is playable exactly the same even if you don't have the original Battle Crest game.

People who know our games will recognize the main character as a Champion trying to avoid rocks, enemy soldiers, trees and practicing equipment while still remembering to salute the Princess in an effort to gain maximum points.

The difficulty level keeps on going up automatically, as you advance. Therefore, the sky is the limit as far as you beating the highscore!""

It was a super simple single screen game with early 80s aesthetics that was set up in a custom 4-player arcade cabinet.  It was set in space with each player as a pistol wielding astronaut in the corner of a zero-g arena, and the object was to be the last man standing in a laser gun shootout.  


The unique gimmick was that the only way to move was by using the recoil from your gun and spinning yourself with the up/down thrust from your jetpack.  In keeping with this control scheme, the cabinet had a single axis joystick (jetpack up/down) and two buttons (start and shoot) for each player.  Similar to classic Asteroids, inertia would conserve your momentum and travelling off the screen would bring you around to the opposite side.

Can anyone tell me what this game was called or where I can go to  find it?  It was a ton of fun and I'd really love to play it again if it's still around.  


Thanks in advance for any help on the topic.

My friends recently published the game they were working on for a uni project, it's a 2D endless runner made by 5 people (2 programmers, 2 artists and 1 designer).

It has no microtransactions and is free to play, it is the first game they have published and it took them 7 weeks to make.

It'd be really great if you could have a play of the game and leave them some feedback in a review.

I think that you might be interested to try my game, Cosmos. 

Cosmos is a game that I wrote back in 1996 and then put up online in 2001.  

It is a multiplayer dice game where players roll dice to score points and work their way to 1200 points. They can also earn other points that come into play at the end of the game, giving them extra turns to try to win.

Game play is very fast and addictive. I never get tired of playing Cosmos and my girlfriend and I play almost every night. 

So...come try my retro Flash game?  Up to 4 people can play at once. See if you can beat us. Maybe we can have a tournament...

IndieGaming,"   Hunternet is a game that is purely skill based with almost zero RNG. I have talked to the developer a bit about his game, and he has been working on it FULLTIME for a staggering five years. Although the majority of that going towards the networking capabilities of allowing a FPS not lag in a 700 player match (With a powerful server he rented for a day, to test the capabilities of his game) The gameplay is extremely fun, fluid, and balanced. Every ""Ability"" has counters, and then those counters have counters which counter other things. One major aspect of this game, is that your projectiles inherit your momentum, so if you are going 32 KMPH (base speed) forwards, it would add that to the rocket speed, making your rocket fly at 107 MPH. To help the learning curve of having to not only lead your opponent, but also yourself, if you middle click your enemy, it will lock onto them, giving you a red reticle. With this red reticle, all you have to do is place it on your enemies ship, and if they continue in that same direction and don't slowdown or speedup, it will be a guaranteed hit, no matter how far they are. Of course if they are across that map and they slow down or speed up just by a little bit, it will be a complete miss.



Your energy is a combination of your health, ammo, and movement. The more you move the less energy you regen a second, the more you shoot, the more energy you expend. So you can think of it as if you are putting all your energy into shields as the baseline, and if you move or shoot, you have to divert that energy to fire, so you need to spray and pray at your own risk. Its a very fast paced game, with a relatively small sized map right now, since he doesn't have a large player base and hasn't released it on steam yet. It is still currently in alpha... but honestly, if he got a couple of good levels, better graphics and limited the match size to 16 players, it would be ready for full release. I myself am not a FPS fan at all, however... for some reason this game captivated me. You can increase your speed like Attack on titan with the ""bungee' skill, use a dash(thrust) to avoid rockets and ram enemies, enemy running away, use the ""Love"" option of the rocket to force them to get close to you, or go towards you, otherwise their energy drains. The goal of the game is currently just to have the highest score on the server. 



The developer plans on keeping it completely F2P and the only monetization coming from skins.  You can currently find it on http://ww.itch.io and looking for the game called ""hunternet"" and the developers website is http://www.cpudreams.com/ The developer is extremely friendly and takes all feedback on discord. You can easily reach him through his discord server, which you can locate on his website.

Hello r/indiegaming!

Void Wisp is a simple game I’m making where you earn points by coming close to obstacles without crashing into them. It controls with two buttons; up and glide. Up, unsurprisingly, moves you upward. Glide will slow your descent. When no buttons are pressed you fall to the game. 

It’s a runner similar to Jetpack Joyride or Helicopter except the gameplay focus is not about just going far but rather risk-v-reward. The closer you get to an obstacle the more points you earn. You’ll lose points if you play too safely. The hitbox for the Wisp is only the very center dot. Everything else is the score area.

[Here’s a short video explaining and showcasing the mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCqIOS8YJS4)

## Features:

You can get this game right now for [$2.50 on itch.io](https://dwoboyle.itch.io/void-wisp). Future prices may increase as content is added.

Be sure to vote for it on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=710063910) as well!!

* 4 game modes that offer unique challenges. Manage distance and score in Classic mode. Get the best score you can in 1 minute in Caravan mode. Survive in an increasingly difficult run in Survival mode. Complete set goals of premade levels in Traveler mode. 

* Challenge your friends by sharing Seeds for levels.

* Accessibility options that means anyone can play and enjoy regardless of skill or ablebodiedness. Including visual customization, game speed, remappable controls, robust custom difficulty settings, and many others. 

* Dreamy procedural melodies. Select an instrument and algorithm and a melody will generate as you come close to obstacles.

* Free demo available. Try before you buy. The demo is streamlined a bit. Features only 2 modes, less obstacle variety, less customization, but should give you a good idea of whether you’ll like the game or not.

* Future Updates. Right now this game is in “alpha”. As of now it’s basically feature complete and all that needs adding is content. I plan to update and refine this game as long as there is interest in it.  

## High Score challenge:

[Try to beat my high score!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDuJdNqlDhk)  

Every now and again I put out high score challenge videos where I set a score within 5 attempts and ask people to record themselves trying to beat it. You don’t have to be a youtuber or streamer to attempt this and this first one can be done with the free demo. 

**If you are a youtuber or streamer and would like a code for the game then please comment or send me a DM with a link to your channel and I’ll be happy to provide a code.**

## Accolades:

Void Wisp was featured as the Seattle Indies Expo in September with almost universal acclaim and will be part of a program at Seattle’s Living Computer Museum featuring local developers. 

## Design Challenges/Discussions:

What I often got hung up on in other projects as a solo dev was feature creep and being overloaded with tasks. So I really tried to rein in my ambition with Void Wisp. Get the basic gameplay done in a day or so then focus on mechanics and features that were the most interesting to me. I wrote a whole big blog about my design philosophies, [which you can read here](http://voidwispgame.tumblr.com/post/152319852994/void-wisp-design-philosophies), but when it comes right down to it what I wanted from Void Wisp was to make a simple game that had a surprising amount of depth and nuance. 

I think I succeeded there, but have certainly had problems trying to communicate that to others. I’ve heard all sort of different criticisms that folks have had about the art or from a quick first glance. I don’t think this game screenshots well. You have to see it in motion to understand it and that’s a big problem. 

One of the other issues I’ve faced communicating how the play the game well. Most people look at Void Wisp and think “Oh I know what to do!” But if you play this like you’ve played similar games you’re not going to do well score-wise. People expect that avoiding obstacles entirely is the right way to play but it’s not. I have tutorial messages and a How To Play, but I’ve found that people generally don’t read for whatever reason. It’s an interesting challenge.

Accessibility is a big focus as well. I want anyone regardless of who they are to be able to play and enjoy this game. However I noticed an interesting push back from certain people about how I go about this. Namely the custom difficulty options. You can fine tune just about anything from game speed, health/lives, additional UI, disabling certain obstacles, etc. As well as presets for folks who don’t want to mess with that stuff. It’s something I’d like to see more of in games. For whatever reason I’ve gotten comments like “why is this here?”, “who would ever use this?”, “don’t play up this feature. People don’t care about this stuff.” and I don’t get it. I follow charities like Ablegamers and SpecialEffect and see the people that benefit for options like this. I think awareness of accessibility issues and designing for the audience that could play the game is very important. Plus it was way easier to implement and design for than, say, gamepad controls.

IndieGaming,"(x-post since some might not be on r/indiegames, want to open the discussion with everyone)

Sup y'all.  This has been a great year for indie games, and I've had the discussion with my friends about the best indie games of 2016 - figured I'd expand that conversation and see what you all thought or what games I might have missed/forgotten.

My top 3 games right now:

**Hyper Light Drifter** - probably will end up my GOTY.  I fell in love with the concept when I joined the Kickstarter a few years ago, and after the long wait, it exceeded all expectations.  From the graphics, the super tight controls, the exploration and world - the game was the perfect homage to the 16-bit era (just without the technical limitations).  If you don't like tough games, this might not be for you - expect to get the ""you died"" feeling somewhat regularly.  The game is never unfair, but it is made to be a challenge.

**Brigador** - Initially I had a hard time with this game because of it's unique control scheme, but once I got used to them, and realized the game was meant to be played strategically (not run-and-gun), I was able to properly appreciate the game.  The reason I actually stuck it out was because I really loved the world building, the lore, and the details they sprinkled all around with the different pilots and factions etc.  Oh, and mech/tank warfare is always my favorite and fully destructible environments make it even awesome-r.  The game really was built in a certain fashion, to be played in a certain fashion, so if you don't want to take the time to learn the controls, or really want to just blow up stuff non-stop, this might not be a the game for you.

**Masquerada** - It's been a very, very long time since a game really gave me feels, but Masquerada did it.  It has a beautiful comicbook art style that really makes the game a joy to look at, but the narrative is the real star here; the writing and world building rivals that of a novel, with a clear understanding of character motives and how they propel the story.  Add to that the professional voice acting and a hauntingly beautiful operatic soundtrack and you get a wonderfully full-bodied experience that many games aspire to but fail.  If you can't get hooked on the story, then it's still a fun time, but you might not see the entire game out (which would be a shame IMO).  As an RPG, the game isn't terribly deep with it's character customization or level ups, and the battles are a little clunky because of silly AI.  Also, the game is terribly, terribly linear and doesn't allow for much free-roaming exploration, but each area does give you small snippets of world building that are nice.  

Honorable mentions:

**Dog Sled Saga** - this game is fun for the same reasons XCOM is fun, but with dogs.  Replace soldiers with puppies (you manage stamina and training instead of weapons upgrades and health), and replace battlefields with a snowy racecourse (depending on how well you time supporting the team, you level-up your dogs), and you've got Dog Sled Saga (I have it on iOS and Steam - both are fun).

**Reigns** - I love playing this game when I have a few minutes on the go (iOS).  It's a wonderful balance of card game style luck and some management sim aspects, and it strikes a wonderful balance of silly with a serious undertone.",Best Indie Games of 2016 - discussion (x-post from r/indiegames)
IndieGaming,"Hey all,

As a software developer, and as a fan of strategy games and competitive gaming, I decided to try and create my own online multiplayer game.

The result is Animancers - currently in open beta, and free to play at www.animancers.com

From my website:

&gt;Animancers is an online turn-based strategy game where the objective is to defeat the opposing player. 
As Animancers, you and your opponent have the ability to summon creatures to assist you in battle! 
The game is designed to be easy to learn, while still retaining strategic depth and competitive viability.

&gt;Animancers is inspired by other turn-based strategy games, yet addresses many of the shortcomings that prevents these games from being highly competitive and reaching a wider audience. For example:


&gt;- Similar resource management to Magic the Gathering, but as a tactical game on a hex-grid map, and without the first-turn advantage. Both players can modify the turn order based on the abilities they use.

&gt;- Similar strategic gameplay to Civilization, but without the excessive time commitment. A game of Animancers usually lasts less than an hour, and daily games let you take turns at your leisure once per day. Also, unlike Civilization, the maps in Animancers are symmetrical, ensuring balanced starting positions.

&gt;- Similar tactics to Fire Emblem, but with far more diverse abilities, and without the time-wasting grinding and leveling processes, or frustrating misses or crits. The only element of chance in Animancers is the random map generation, which determines the optimal creature types and abilities to use for each game.

&gt;- Similar aesthetic and team-building gameplay to Pokemon, but without the need to memorize thousands of moves, stats, and type combinations. Animancers has just over 100 abilities, and they have different usage and effectiveness based on a creature's types and stats, which are intuitive and easy to learn.


&gt;The game is free to play in beta, and has an in-depth tutorial, so try it out and let me know what you think!

All feedback is appreciated, but especially the following:

- Art direction: I'm a programmer, not an artist.  Before hiring an artist to replace my hodgepodge of borrowed images, I want to make sure the general aesthetic of the game is enjoyable.

- Balancing: Minimal so far.  I've hesitated to do any serious balancing until a clear optimal strategy is discovered.

- Character design: As of now, the creatures in the game have generic names and no description, because they are dependent on the general aesthetic- should the game be serious or light-hearted?  To what extent should violence be depicted in a game involving animals?

- Any bugs you might find, especially with the Mac and Linux versions (I'm testing on a Windows PC).

Again, check out the game at www.animancers.com and let me know what you think.  Thanks for your time!",[SP - game] Animancers - an online multiplayer turn-based strategy game in open beta (looking for feedback)
IndieGaming,"So, a little background, [Strikers Edge](http://strikersedgegame.com/) is an indie ""dodgeball-like"" game. It has been talked about on this sub and others. I already knew it from here. The developers are portuguese, like me, and this week there was a game conference in Lisbon. They were there and I tried the game for the first time.

It is, easily, THE most fun game I played there. Or anywhere. Just. Pure. Fun.

I walked by their stand and saw it there. My friend and I already knew it from Reddit, so we thought we gave it a shot. We played the PS4 version coming this year, althought there will be a Steam Veion coming sometime around the first quarter of 2017.

**About the game itself:**
 
* The version we played had like 6 different characters. Each had it's own unique playstile: you press R2 to shoot, and hold R2 to charge your special power up on release. Special powers vary a lot: one fired a hook that would damage and pull the enemy with R1; this pull would briefly stun the enemy and cause your next shot to do critical damage. Another one would fire an electrically charged kinfe that would be stuck on the arena for a while; you could then press R1 to make it discharge in a small area and if the enemy was hit, you'd damage and stun an enemy. Another would fire a flaming arrow, causing the enemy to loose health over time, etc. you get the point. Besides this, some had unique abilities, for example, to block, you'd have to press L1 at the exact time you'd get hit. But there was this one character that if you missed the timming, you'd take reduced damage but spend a block charge anyway (due to his armor). They all offer a different playstyle.
* It also had 2 different arenas: a basic one with grass and 2 rocks on each side where you could find some cover and another, in the snow, where periodically, ice would fall. They are working on 4 new arenas.

**About the playstyle:**

* The gameplay is easy to catch on, but at first it is hard to coordinate your character's position, plus the projectile direction to make it all the way to your opponent's position and land there after the travel time. But after one Bo3, we had it. 
* Like the trailer shows, you have to hit the opponent and dodge or block his projectiles. You move with the left stick, aim with the right stick and fire on R2, releasing a special power by holding the same key that could perform a certain action by pressing R1 (exploding, pulling, discharging, stun, etc). L2 would make you dodge and L1, if pressed on the exact time you get hit, would make you block, if not, you'd take damage anyway.
* You have health, stamina and block charges. **Health** is intuitive: you have a certain amout and when hit, you loose a certain amount. When it reaches 0, you loose. **Stamina** automatically refills over time and you spend it to fire, dodge our use your special power. **Block charges** are basically stacks that say how many times you can block. You start with 3 on both the maps I played. It doesn't refill but the developers are thinking on a mechanic to make it so. You have charges to force you to play and don't stay on defensive all the time. In later phases of each round, you have no rocks or ice to get cover, so you'd block or dodge. Because of the block charges would eventually run out, you'd be forced to dodge and counter attack. This makes the game more intense.

As for us, we played 2 or 3 Bo3 at first but we would eventually return there for a rematch. Not once. Not twice. We would be back 5 times to play this game. And each time, we would play 4 or 5 matches. By the late 3 times we were back, I lost every damn game, but couldn't help to smile and laugh while playing it. It was so intense, but at the same time, so much fun and awsome. Outstanding game. So much fun.",Strikers Edge: small review
